We used a novel targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panel to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to detect somatic mutations and gene amplification in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: cfDNA from pretreated patients (n = 42) and 9 healthy controls were compared with matched lymphocyte DNA by NGS, using a custom 158 amplicon panel covering hot-spot mutations and CNAs in 16 genes, with further validation of results by droplet digital PCR. RESULTS: No mutations were identified in cfDNA of healthy controls, whereas exactly half the patients with metastatic breast cancer had at least one mutation or amplification in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-6) across a total of 13 genes. Longitudinal follow up showed dynamic changes to mutations and gene amplification in cfDNA indicating clonal and subclonal response to treatment that was more dynamic than cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3). Interestingly, at the time of blood sampling disease progression was occurring in 7 patients with erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) gene amplification in their cfDNA and 3 of these patients were human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative at diagnosis, suggesting clonal evolution to a more aggressive phenotype. Lastly, 6 patients harbored estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations in cfDNA, suggesting resistance to endocrine therapy. Overall 9 of 42 patients (21%) had alterations in cfDNA that could herald a change in treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential for monitoring response to targeted therapies through both mutations and gene amplification, for analysis of dynamic tumor heterogeneity and stratification to targeted therapy.\n27940449\t118\t131\tBreast Cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27940449\t145\t158\tBreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27940449\t415\t420\twomen\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t437\t450\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27940449\t452\t455\tMBC\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27940449\t489\t497\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t816\t824\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t841\t854\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n27940449\t1127\t1146\tcancer antigen 15-3\tGene\t4582\n27940449\t1148\t1154\tCA15-3\tGene\t4582\n27940449\t1241\t1249\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t1271\t1279\ttyrosine\tChemical\t\n27940449\t1290\t1295\tERBB2\tGene\t2064\n27940449\t1346\t1354\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t1360\t1365\thuman\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t1366\t1400\tepidermal growth factor receptor 2\tGene\t2064\n27940449\t1402\t1406\tHER2\tGene\t2064\n27940449\t1501\t1509\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t1519\t1538\testrogen receptor 1\tGene\t2099\n27940449\t1540\t1544\tESR1\tGene\t2099\n27940449\t1626\t1634\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n27940449\t1873\t1878\ttumor\tDisease\tMESH:D009369\n\n28058064|t|ASCO 2016: highlights in breast cancer.\n28058064|a|At the 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting, several pertinent studies in the field of breast cancer were presented. MA17.R was the first randomized phase III trial to evaluate the prolongation of adjuvant aromatase-inhibitor (AI) therapy from 5 to 10 years; while a significant reduction of disease-free survival events was observed in the extended treatment group, the absolute difference was relatively small and longer endocrine therapy resulted in a higher fracture rate. A combined analysis of three North American trials emphasized the superiority of anthracycline containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens compared with docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC), while the PANTHER trial investigated dose-dense tailored adjuvant treatment. In metastatic breast cancer, the main interest was on cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors. In PALOMA-2, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) from 14.5 to 24.8 months resulting in the longest PFS data ever reported in the first-line setting. A subgroup analysis of premenopausal patients accrued to PALOMA-3 indicated that in this patient subset, ovarian function suppression plus fulvestrant and palbociclib yielded results comparable to the postmenopausal population. ESR1 mutations were another focus of interest as these activating mutations in the gene coding for the estrogen receptor alpha apparently evolve under the selection pressure of AI therapy.\n28058064\t25\t38\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28058064\t115\t128\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28058064\t490\t498\tfracture\tDisease\tMESH:D050723\n28058064\t586\t599\tanthracycline\tChemical\tMESH:D018943\n28058064\t656\t665\tdocetaxel\tChemical\tMESH:C067311\n28058064\t666\t682\tcyclophosphamide\tChemical\tMESH:D003520\n28058064\t780\t793\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28058064\t820\t853\tcyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6\tGene\t1019;1021\n28058064\t910\t919\tletrozole\tChemical\tMESH:C067431\n28058064\t1099\t1107\tpatients\tSpecies\t9606\n28058064\t1151\t1158\tpatient\tSpecies\t9606\n28058064\t1167\t1200\tovarian function suppression plus\tDisease\tMESH:D010049\n28058064\t1201\t1212\tfulvestrant\tChemical\tMESH:C070081\n28058064\t1290\t1294\tESR1\tGene\t2099\n28058064\t1393\t1416\testrogen receptor alpha\tGene\t2099\n\n28078498|t|Perinatal Exposure to Bisphenol A or Diethylstilbestrol Increases the Susceptibility to Develop Mammary Gland Lesions After Estrogen Replacement Therapy in Middle-Aged Rats.\n28078498|a|The development of the mammary gland is a hormone-regulated event. Several factors can dysregulate its growth and make the gland more susceptible to cellular transformation. Among these factors, perinatal exposure to xenoestrogens and hormone replacement therapy has been associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer. Here, we assessed the effects induced by estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in ovariectomized (OVX) middle-aged rats and whether perinatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) or bisphenol A (BPA) modified these effects in the mammary gland. Pregnant rats were orally exposed to vehicle, 5 mug DES/kg/day, or 0.5 or 50 mug BPA/kg/day from gestational day 9 until weaning. Then, 12-month-old offspring were OVX and treated with 17beta-estradiol for 3 months. Morphological changes and the percentage of epithelial cells that proliferated or expressed estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PR) were analyzed in mammary gland samples of 15-month-old animals. ERT induced lobuloalveolar hyperplasia and ductal cysts in the mammary gland of middle-aged rats, associated with a higher proliferation index of epithelial cells. Perinatal exposure to DES followed by ERT increased the number of cysts and induced the formation of fibroadenoma and ductal carcinoma in situ, without modifying the expression of ESR1 or PR. Also, after 3 months of ERT, BPA-exposed rats had a higher incidence of ductal hyperplasia and atypical lobular hyperplasia than animals under ERT alone. In conclusion, perinatal exposure to xenoestrogens increases the susceptibility of the mammary gland to develop cysts and hyperplastic lesions when confronted with ERT later in life.\n28078498\t22\t33\tBisphenol A\tChemical\tMESH:C006780\n28078498\t37\t55\tDiethylstilbestrol\tChemical\tMESH:D004054\n28078498\t124\t132\tEstrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n28078498\t168\t172\tRats\tSpecies\t10116\n28078498\t391\t404\txenoestrogens\tChemical\t\n28078498\t491\t504\tbreast cancer\tDisease\tMESH:D001943\n28078498\t547\t555\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n28078498\t618\t622\trats\tSpecies\t10116\n28078498\t657\t675\tdiethylstilbestrol\tChemical\tMESH:D004054\n28078498\t685\t696\tbisphenol A\tChemical\tMESH:C006780\n28078498\t698\t701\tBPA\tChemical\tMESH:C089739\n28078498\t757\t761\trats\tSpecies\t10116\n28078498\t829\t832\tBPA\tChemical\tMESH:C089739\n28078498\t933\t949\t17beta-estradiol\tChemical\tMESH:D004958\n28078498\t1056\t1064\testrogen\tChemical\tMESH:D004967\n28078498\t1081\t1085\tESR1\tGene\t24890\n28078498\t1091\t1112\tprogesterone receptor\tGene\t25154\n28078498\t1114\t1116\tPR\tGene\t25154\n28078498\t1194\t1220\tlobuloalveolar hyperplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D006965\n28078498\t1232\t1237\tcysts\tDisease\tMESH:D003560\n28078498\t1274\t1278\trats\tSpecies\t10116\n28078498\t1412\t1417\tcysts\tDisease\tMESH:D003560\n28078498\t1447\t1459\tfibroadenoma\tDisease\tMESH:D018226\n28078498\t1464\t1480\tductal carcinoma\tDisease\tMESH:D044584\n28078498\t1526\t1530\tESR1\tGene\t24890\n28078498\t1534\t1536\tPR\tGene\t25154\n28078498\t1567\t1570\tBPA\tChemical\tMESH:C089739\n28078498\t1579\t1583\trats\tSpecies\t10116\n28078498\t1610\t1628\tductal hyperplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D006965\n28078498\t1650\t1661\thyperplasia\tDisease\tMESH:D006965\n28078498\t1729\t1742\txenoestrogens\tChemical\t\n28078498\t1804\t1809\tcysts\tDisease\tMESH:D003560\n28078498\t1814\t1834\thyperplastic lesions\tDisease\tMESH:D054514\n\n'
