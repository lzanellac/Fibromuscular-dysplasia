Fibromuscular dysplasia is rarely biopsied. Progesterone receptor expression in
myofibroblastic cells is useful for the histopathological evaluation in
difficult-to-diagnose cases. Herein, we report two unusual cases of fibromuscular
dysplasia in which progesterone receptor expression was shown in vessel sections.

CONTEXT: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a cause of acute
coronary syndrome, which predominantly affects healthy women; however, few data
define this vulnerable population.
OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with 
SCAD and determine outcomes in a community-based cohort.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with SCAD at Kaiser Permanente
Northern California during a 10-year period. We compared 111 SCAD cases with 333 
healthy, matched controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predisposing factors, treatment modalities, and inhospital
and late outcomes.
RESULTS: Patients with SCAD had a mean age (standard deviation) of 48.1 (11)
years; 92.8% were women, and 49.5% were nonwhite. Of women, 9% were peripartum.
Fibromuscular dysplasia was identified in 21.8% of femoral angiograms obtained.
With conditional logistic regression, only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were
associated with SCAD compared with controls. Fifty-five patients (49.5%) were
successfully treated without revascularization; of the 54 who had urgent
percutaneous coronary intervention, 2 required coronary artery bypass grafting
for SCAD extension. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, major adverse
cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1% of patients. Pregnancy-related SCAD was
not associated with worsened outcomes. However, Emergency Department visits or
hospitalizations because of recurrent chest pain occurred frequently for 54% of
patients with SCAD.
CONCLUSION: The study cohort is comparable to published SCAD cohorts, but notable
for a racially and ethnically diverse population. Compared with the controls,
only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were associated with SCAD. For the SCAD cases, 
major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1%, and race did not influence 
outcomes.

Fatal Ascending Aortic Dissection: Case Report and Discussion of Diseases Causing
Both Presentations.

Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of
acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aortic dissection and SCAD share common
aetiologies such as a fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), Marfan, Ehlers Danlos, and
more rarely systemic lupus erythematosus and Loeys-Dietz; however, SCAD has never
been known to have a familial association with aortic dissection.
Case Summary: This case report describes a 48-year-old woman suffering from SCAD 
who had a mother who died from ascending aortic dissection in her 50s.
Discussion: This is the first case report to our knowledge of a patient with SCAD
with a first-degree relative with aortic dissection. Our case is interesting in
that it shows that if predisposition to arterial dissection was inherited from
mother to daughter, one of them suffered an extremely rare manifestation of their
underlying disease. It also shows that a high index of suspicion is needed for
SCAD in the presence of a patient with ACS and a family history of dissection
elsewhere in the arterial tree.

A case is reported of a 40-year-old woman clinically diagnosed as moyamoya
disease with associated fibromuscular dysplasia of intrapulmonary bronchial
arteries incidentally revealed during autoptic examination. Moyamoya disease
represents an idiopathic noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic arterio-occlusive
process of intracranial arteries. Prolonged brain ischemia leads to formation of 
tiny and fragile collaterals. Clinically, patients with moyamoya angiopathy
commonly present with severe neurological symptoms caused by brain infarction or 
hemorrhage. Histologically, the steno-occlusive process is based on fibrocellular
thickening of intima and intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation. In the
literature, extracranial arterial involvement, i.e. fibromuscular dysplasia of
renal or pulmonary arteries, has been described in several cases of moyamoya
disease. Our aim is to show a unique case of moyamoya disease associated with
fibromuscular dysplasia affecting an uncommon site.

BACKGROUND: Carotid web (CaW) is a shelf-like linear filling defect in the
posterior aspect of the internal carotid bulb, representing an intimal variant of
fibromuscular dysplasia. The diagnosis of CaW is traditionally restricted to
digital subtraction angiography (DSA), CT/MR angiography (CTA/MRA), and Duplex
ultrasonography. In this series of patients with acute ischemic stroke, we
evaluated the potential utility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in further
characterizing suspected CaWs.
METHODS: This is a case series of three patients with suspected CaW who underwent
DSA for treatment or investigation of large vessel occlusion strokes. In all
cases the stroke investigation failed to identify an alternative cause, and the
stroke etiology was attributed to a symptomatic CaW. The procedure consisted of
positioning a guide catheter in the common carotid artery, navigating the IVUS
probe distal to the carotid bulb, and then retracting the probe with a manual
pullback. The acquired images were then reviewed in an independent workstation
RESULTS: In two of the three cases, IVUS showed an isoechoic-to-hyperechoic focal
eccentric area at the posterior carotid bulb, consistent with CaW. The
endoluminal protrusion was inconspicuous on IVUS due to the low resolution of
ultrasound not allowing a clear differentiation between fibrosis, thrombosis, and
atherosclerosis. No abnormalities commonly associated with atherosclerotic
disease or dissections were noted. The CaW could not be depicted in the third
patient.
CONCLUSION: The use of IVUS in the diagnosis of CaW may have limited relevance.
Continued investigation of other imaging modalities for accurate CaW diagnosis is
recommended.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cryptogenic stroke describes a subset of ischemic stroke for
which no cause can be found despite a structured investigation. There are a
number of putative mechanisms of cryptogenic ischemic stroke including a covert
structural cardiac lesion, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state 
or undiagnosed malignancy. Because many of these proposed mechanisms are embolic 
- and based on studies of thrombus history showing commonalities between thrombus
composition between cardioembolic and cryptogenic strokes - the concept of
embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) (Hart et al. Lancet Neurol.
13(4):429-38, 2014; Stroke. 48(4):867-72, 2017) has been proposed to describe
cryptogenic strokes that may warrant systemic anticoagulation. In this review, we
discuss the phenomena of cryptogenic stroke, ESUS and a proposed management
pathway.
RECENT FINDINGS: 1. The concept of ESUS was proposed in 2014 as a potentially
useful therapeutic entity. Two recent trials - NAVIGATE-ESUS (Hart et al. N Engl 
J Med. 378(23):2191-201, 2018) and RESPECT-ESUS (Diener 2018) were proposed based
on this concept. They were negative for their primary endpoint and for the
secondary endpoint of ischemic stroke recurrence. Post-hoc analysis of the WARSS 
trial (Longstreth et al. Stroke. 44(3):714-9, 2013) suggested that people with
elevated pro-BNP benefited from systemic anticoagulation whereas those with a
normal pro-BNP did not. This led to the hypothesis that a subgroup of patients at
higher risk for embolism from the left atrium would benefit from anticoagulation,
even if the WARSS trial was negative for the primary endpoint. Thus, the ARCADIA 
trial (Kamel et al. Int J Stroke. 14(2):207-14, 2019) was proposed - a
randomized, active-control, multi-center trial comparing apixaban with aspirin
for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ESUS and biomarkers of left
atrial cardiopathy. This trial is actively recruiting. 2. Carotid web - an
intimal form of fibromuscular dysplasia - has come to increased prominence in the
literature as a cause of embolic stroke. It is a non-stenosis,
non-atherosclerotic lesion in the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery
that leads to pooling with stasis of blood distal to the lesion and, as a
consequence, embolic stroke. It is not usually detected by a standard stroke
workup as it masquerades as non-calcified atherosclerosis and does not cause
hemodynamically significant stenosis. There have been two major recent papers - a
meta-analysis in Stroke (Zhang et al. Stroke. 49(12):2872-6, 2018) and narrative 
review in JAMA Neurology (Kim et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018) - that addressed this
topic. Cryptogenic stroke describes a stroke for which no cause has been found.
ESUS is a more precisely-defined entity that mandates a specific workup and
implicates remote embolism as a cause of stroke. In ESUS, the options for further
investigation include long-term cardiac monitoring, transesophageal
echocardiography, investigation for occult malignancy or arterial
hypercoagulability. Options for management include anti-platelet therapy (the
current standard of care), empiric anticoagulation or enrollment in to a clinical
trial examining the use of NOACs compared with aspirin for secondary prevention
(such as ARCADIA or ATTICUS). In a person less than 60 years old with ESUS and a 
patent foramen ovale the risk of a recurrent stroke is low but recent trials have
suggested that percutaneous device closure reduces this risk further with an
acceptable complication rate.

We present a case of a 61-year-old woman who suffered a haemorrhagic complication
of an aneurysmal left lingual artery, secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia,
following transoral robotic surgery (TORS). She was admitted through the
emergency department 3 days after resection of a central base of tongue tumour.
She suffered a massive haemorrhage requiring intensive care admission, blood
transfusion, intubation, operative and endovascular intervention. The diagnosis
of fibromuscular dysplasia was made at angiography. During attempts to embolise
the culprit left lingual artery, the vessel dissected at its origin leading to
arrest of bleeding. Repeat angiograms during her admission demonstrated unchanged
appearances and ruled out recanalisation of the vessel. She was extubated and
remained stable on the ward, discharged home some days later in good health. To
our knowledge, this is the first ever reported case of fibromuscular dysplasia
affecting the lingual artery leading to aneurysmal dilation and severe
haemorrhage following TORS.

INTRODUCTION: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) may be symptomatic. The treatment of
these lesions is primarily medical but may sometimes require surgical or
endovascular revascularization. RAS angioplasty is well controlled but its
results are discussed. The objective of this work was to report the short- and
long-term results of the endovascular treatment of renal arteries in our center.
METHODS: We report a retrospective study between 2013 and 2018, including
patients who received endovascular treatment for severe symptomatic RAS (≥75%).
RESULTS: Our population consisted of 17 patients. Mean age was 51.1 years
[18-76], sex ratio 2.4. RAS was discovered during work-up for severe renovascular
hypertension resistant to medical treatment for 16 patients and rapidly
progressive renal failure for one patient. The etiology retained was:
atherosclerosis (9 cases), fibromuscular dysplasia (6 cases) and Takayasu's
disease (2 cases). The average stenosis rate was 85.9% [75-97%]. We performed
simple angioplasty in 47% of the cases and stenting in 53%. The technical success
rate was 100%. At 1 month, morbidity-mortality rates were zero. Mean follow-up
was 12 months [6-36 months]. Patients with renovascular hypertension experienced 
a decrease in blood pressure, with discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy in
62.5% of cases and reduction of doses in 37.5% of cases. The permeability rate
was 100% at 1 year, 94% at 2 years and 94% at 3 years. One patient had
asymptomatic stent thrombosis at the 18th month. The restenosis rate was zero.
CONCLUSION: Angioplasty of symptomatic RAS may be indicated as first-line
treatment. It is associated with satisfactory results in the short and long
terms.

The two main non-iatrogenic causes of secondary hypertension in women of
childbearing age are primary aldosteronism and renal fibromuscular dysplasia. It 
is recommended to look for a secondary hypertension in women who remain
hypertensive three months after pregnancy, in patients under 40 years of age or
in patients with a grade 3 HTN (BP≥180/110mm Hg) (Professional agreement). It is 
suggested that the initial assessment of a secondary HTN in women is performed by
a HTN specialist; it will include an assessment of renin and aldosterone
concentrations and an angio-CT of the renal arteries (or angio-MRI if
contraindicated) (Grade C - Class 2).

INTRODUCTION: The association between neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and
vasculopathy has been reported frequently, especially cerebral, intestinal, and
peripheral vasculopathy. However, cutaneous vasculopathy is infrequent.
CASE REPORT: The authors present the case of a 32-year-old man with a painful
ulcer on his left thigh of 3 weeks' duration in the same location as a long-time 
capillary malformation associated with alopecia. The skin biopsy showed signs of 
perivascular fibromuscular dysplasia with proliferating myofibroblastic cells.
The patient had been treated with various therapeutic options, such as topical
antibiotics, oral and intralesional corticosteroids, and oral cyclosporine and
intravenous prostanoids.
CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous vasculopathy related to the skin, such as livedo
reticularis and ulcers of torpid evolution due to cutaneous vasculopathy are
extremely rare. Thus, it is necessary to include skin ulcers as one of the
phenotypic manifestations of NF-1.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of
idiopathic non-atherosclerotic causes of carotid artery disease and its
manifestations.
RECENT FINDINGS: Four major causes of non-atherosclerotic carotid artery disease 
including dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, moyamoya disease, and inflammatory
large vessel vasculitis are discussed. While there is a dearth of clinical trials
involving some of the rarer conditions, recent data from clinical trials
supporting antiplatelet over anticoagulation treatment of cervical artery
dissection, recent consensus statements on the management of fibromuscular
dysplasia, and guideline approaches to diagnosis and treatment of large vessel
vasculitis are summarized. Idiopathic non-atherosclerotic causes of carotid
artery disease are under appreciated and may lead to significant morbidity and
mortality. While less common compared with atherosclerotic disease,
non-atherosclerotic disease may affect younger patient populations and result in 
non-cerebrovascular arterial involvement and systemic organ damage. Therefore,
prompt recognition of these disorders is key to their management.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) has recently been associated with spontaneous
coronary artery dissection (SCAD). We sought to further elucidate the association
of FMD with SCAD. We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients with
SCAD evaluated at our institution from 2008 to 2019. Baseline characteristics,
coronary angiographic data, and screening for FMD were recorded. In patients who 
completed screening for FMD, variables were compared between patients with FMD
and those without. We identified 51 patients with SCAD, all of whom were female, 
with a mean age of 46.8 years. A quarter of patients underwent percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) and half of those suffered a complication during PCI.
78% of patients underwent complete screening for FMD, of which 63% were diagnosed
with multifocal FMD. Vascular abnormalities other than FMD were found in 70% of
screened patients. Patients with FMD were older than those without FMD (50.7 vs
42.6 years, p = 0.006). FMD was more frequently associated with type 2 SCAD (84% 
vs 47%, p = 0.025), tortuous non-SCAD coronaries (96% vs 53%, p = 0.002), and
other vascular abnormalities (84% vs 47%, p = 0.03). In conclusion, the majority 
of patients within the all-female cohort with SCAD were found to have FMD. Other 
vascular abnormalities were also common. Patients with FMD were older and were
more likely to have type 2 SCAD, tortuous non-SCAD coronary arteries, and other
vascular abnormalities.

Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has gained attention as
an important cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death (SCD)
among women. Management strategies of SCAD differ from those of atherosclerotic
disease. There is an elevated risk of complications and suboptimal outcomes in
patients with SCAD undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs).
Case summary: A 48-year-old woman without any traditional cardiovascular risk
factors was admitted with severe central chest pain with associated dyspnoea and 
diaphoresis. The patient had a strong family history of SCD, affecting three
female members in their 40s and 50s. Cardiac troponins were elevated. Coronary
angiogram showed moderate to severe stenosis of the proximal circumflex coronary 
artery. Optical coherence tomography confirmed SCAD with sub-intimal haematoma.
Despite significant stenosis in the proximal segment of a relatively large
artery, a decision was made not to proceed with PCI. The follow-up angiogram
demonstrated normal coronaries. Magnetic resonance imaging of renal arteries
showed features suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the right renal
artery. Subsequent genetic counselling and gene testing were unremarkable.
Discussion: Conservative management of SCAD is recommended because the large
majority of SCAD lesions heal naturally, whereas PCI is associated with increased
risk of complications and adverse outcomes. Whether SCAD is associated with the
sudden death events in our patient's family remains unclear. It certainly raises 
concerns as to an inheritable condition. In the absence of post-mortem findings
in her family members, we can only speculate about this representing a possible
inheritable form of SCAD.

Internal mammary artery aneurysms are rare but serious clinical entities. Rupture
results in hemothorax and can be life threatening. Most reported cases are
pseudoaneurysms secondary to iatrogenic or traumatic causes. Noniatrogenic,
nontraumatic, true internal mammary artery aneurysms have most commonly been
associated with vasculitides or connective tissue disorders; rare cases have been
deemed idiopathic. We describe a rare case of bilateral internal mammary artery
aneurysms-successfully treated with coil embolization-in the setting of
heterozygosity for a missense variant of unknown significance in the COL5A1 gene 
and multifocal fibrodysplastic changes on angiography.

Renovascular disease (RVD) is a major cause of secondary hypertension.
Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common type of RVD followed by 
fibromuscular dysplasia. It has long been recognized as the prototype of
angiotensin-dependent hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying the
physiopathology of hypertensive occlusive vascular renal disease are complex and 
distinction between the different causes of RVD should be made. Recognition of
these distinct types of RVD with different degrees of renal occlusive disease is 
important for management. The greatest challenge is to individualize and
implement the best approach for each patient in the setting of widely different
comorbidities.

Grange syndrome (OMIM 602531) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized
by severe early onset vascular occlusive disease and variable penetrance of
brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. Grange
syndrome is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function
variants in the YYA1P1 gene. We report on the case of a 53-year old female with
novel homozygous missense variants in YYA1P1 (c.1079C>T, p.Pro360Leu), presenting
with a history of brachysyndactyly, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. Imaging
studies revealed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid with extensive
collateralization of cerebral vessels in a moyamoya-like pattern, along with
stenosis in the splenic, common hepatic, celiac, left renal, and superior
mesenteric arteries. Functional studies conducted with the patient's dermal
fibroblasts suggest that the p.Pro360Leu variant decreases the stability of the
YY1AP1 protein. This is the first report of a missense variant associated with
Grange syndrome characterized by later onset of vascular disease and a lack of
developmental delay and bone fragility.

AIM: To assess the dynamics of blood flow in patients with hemodynamically
significant pathological kinked internal carotid arteries (PK ICA) with their
orthostatic and rotational positions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients, including 35 with PK ICA due to
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and 51 with PK ICA due to hypertensive heart
disease, and 20 healthy people were examined. All patients underwent Doppler
ultrasound scanning. All indicators were evaluated in the position of the patient
lying on his back and functional stress tests (orthostatic, rotational).
RESULTS: The peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, peripheral
resistance index did not differ significantly in patients with PK ICA due to FMD 
and hypertensive heart disease. The increase of blood flow in bends was
significantly higher with S-shaped kinking, regardless of the reason for their
formation (p<0.05). In orthostatic position, significant changes of hemodynamic
parameters in ICA in healthy people did not occur. Moreover, more frequent
formation of turbulent blood flows in the group with hypertensive heart disease
(78%) and a decrease in LBFV in the standing position were found in patients with
PK ICA due to FMD. Rotational position did not alter the hemodynamics in ICA in
healthy people and significantly influenced the values of LBFV in patients with
PK ICA.
CONCLUSION: Changes in hemodynamic parameters in the area of kinking with
orthostatic and rotational positions of ICA demonstrate more significant
impairments in patients with PK ICA due to hypertensive heart disease compared to
patients with FMD. The rotational position of PK ICA is the most informative for 
identifying turbulent blood flow and an increase in peak systolic velocity in the
area of kinking.

Publisher: Оценка динамики характера кровотока у пациентов с гемодинамически
значимыми патологическими извитостями (ПИ) внутренних сонных артерий (ВСА) при их
ортостатической и ротационной транспозициях.Обследованы 86 пациентов (35 с ПИ ВСА
на фоне дисплазии соединительной ткани и 51 с ПИ ВСА вследствие гипертонической
болезни) и 20 условно здоровых людей. Всем больным было проведено дуплексное
сканирование. Все показатели оценивали в положении пациента лежа на спине и при
функциональных нагрузочных пробах (ортостатической; ротационной).Пиковая
систолическая, конечная диастолическая скорость кровотока и индекс
периферического сопротивления значимо не отличались у пациентов с ПИ ВСА на фоне 
гипертонической болезни и дисплазии соединительной ткани. Прирост линейной
скорости кровотока в изгибах был достоверно выше при S-образных извитостях вне
зависимости от причины их формирования (p<0,05). При ортостатической транспозиции
значимых изменений показателей гемодинамики во ВСА не происходило у здоровых
людей, выявлено более частое формирование турбулентных потоков крови в группе с
гипертонической болезнью (78%) и снижение линейной скорости кровотока в положении
стоя у пациентов с ПИ ВСА на фоне дисплазии соединительной ткани. Ротационная
транспозиция не изменяла гемодинамики во ВСА у здоровых людей и значимо влияла на
показатели линейной скорости кровотока у пациентов с ПИ ВСА.Изменения показателей
гемодинамики в области извитости при ортостатической и ротационной транспозициях 
ВСА демонстрируют более значимые нарушения у пациентов с ПИ ВСА на фоне
гипертонической болезни по сравнению с пациентами с дисплазией соединительной
ткани. Ротационная транспозиция ПИ ВСА является наиболее информативной для
выявления турбулентных потоков крови и прироста пиковой линейной скорости
кровотока в зоне извитости.

Liver cirrhosis can cause splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) that pose a threat to
patients undergoing liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation with
multiple visceral artery aneurysms including giant SAA caused by arterial
fragility has never been reported. We describe a 36-year-old man with
decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease that was complicated by giant
SAA and multiple aneurysms in the bilateral renal arteries caused by
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The maximal diameter of the triple snowball-shaped
SAA was 11 cm. We planned a 2-stage strategy consisting of a splenectomy with
distal pancreatectomy to treat the SAA and subsequent living donor liver
transplantation (LDLT) to address the liver cirrhosis. This strategy was selected
to prevent fatal postoperative infectious complications caused by the potential
development of pancreatic fistula during simultaneous procedures and to
histopathologically diagnose the arterial lesion before LDLT to promote safe
hepatic artery reconstruction. However, a postoperative pancreatic fistula did
not develop after a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy, and the pathologic
findings of the artery indicated FMD. The patient underwent ABO-identical LDLT
with a right lobe graft donated by his brother. Other than postoperative rupture 
of the aneurysm in the left renal artery requiring emergency interventional
radiology, the patient has remained free of any other arterial complications and 
continues to do well at 2 years after LDLT.

Various imaging techniques play a role in the diagnosis of CNS vasculopathies,
which comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders, including various
noninflammatory and inflammatory etiologies. Noninflammatory vasculopathies
include entities such as CADASIL, Susac, moyamoya, fibromuscular dysplasia,
vasculopathy of connective tissue disorders, and reversible vasoconstriction
syndrome. Inflammatory vasculopathies include vasculitides of different vessel
sizes, primary angiitis of the CNS, vasculitis of systemic disease, and
vasculitis secondary to specific causes. Miscellaneous etiology includes cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, which has noninflammatory and inflammatory subtypes. This
article discusses important clinical and imaging findings used to distinguish
these disorders.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: update 2019.

Columbia, Canada.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important 
cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in women with few or no conventional
cardiovascular risk factors. Lack of awareness about this condition among
healthcare providers had led to significant underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in
this relatively young patient population.
RECENT FINDINGS: The current review summarizes the contemporary data on cause,
management strategies and outcomes of SCAD.
SUMMARY: SCAD is not as rare as previously thought, accounting for up to 4% of
all acute coronary syndromes. It is frequently linked with predisposing factors, 
such as fibromuscular dysplasia or other vasculopathies, and is often triggered
by physical or emotional stress. Due to more fragile vessel architecture,
coronary angiography as the first-line diagnostic tool should be performed
meticulously to avoid iatrogenic dissection. Intravascular imaging may be
required if angiographic findings are uncertain. Unless patients have high-risk
features such as ongoing ischemia, recurrent chest pains, left main artery
dissection, ventricular arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability, a conservative
treatment strategy is favored over revascularization. Close monitoring is
essential after a SCAD-event as recurrent cardiovascular events post-SCAD are
frequent.

BACKGROUND: Young individuals with symptomatic carotid webs may be predisposed to
ischemic strokes. However, evidence remains scarce. This investigation reports
the frequency of carotid webs among patients with cryptogenic strokes compared to
a control group.
METHODS: Consecutive cryptogenic ischemic strokes and trauma patients were
identified. Additional inclusion criteria required age 18-60 years and
availability of head/neck computed tomography (CT) angiography. CT angiogram
(CTA) neck images were evaluated independently by 2 fellowshiptrained
specialists. A carotid web was defined by a shelf-like, linear filling defect in 
the posterior internal carotid artery bulb.
RESULTS: Of 1877 patients presenting with ischemic strokes in 2015-2017, 165 were
diagnosed with cryptogenic strokes, 51 of whom met the inclusion criteria of age 
and CTA availability. Fifty one trauma cases were matched for age and sex. After 
imaging analysis, 13 carotid webs (25%) were identified in the 51 cryptogenic
stroke group versus 0 (0%; P < .001) in trauma subjects. Thirty-nine of the 51
cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients were found with carotid anterior
distribution infarcts, of which 9 (23%) were found with ipsilateral carotid webs.
There were more proximal large vessel occlusions in the cryptogenic patients with
carotid webs, compared to those without (P = .04). All carotid webs led to less
than 30% degree of stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid webs were found at a significantly higher frequency in
patients with cryptogenic ischemic strokes compared to controls, indicating a
potentially thrombogenic nature of these lesions in young patients. Additionally,
intracranial large vessel occlusions were more common in patients with
symptomatic carotid webs, presenting with ipsilateral strokes.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is an idiopathic, nonatheromatous, and noninflammatory
arterial disease that most commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries. We
report a child with subarachnoid and ocular hemorrhage associated with an
aneurysm due to fibromuscular dysplasia. Computed tomography following a
witnessed collapse revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe cerebral
edema. An autopsy confirmed the radiographic findings and detected bilateral
retinal hemorrhages, optic nerve sheath hemorrhages, and a ruptured saccular
aneurysm due to focal fibromuscular dysplasia involving the intracranial right
vertebral artery. This case documents a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage in a child 
with an intracranial saccular aneurysm caused by fibromuscular dysplasia. The
associated retinal hemorrhages are easily detected by postmortem monocular
indirect ophthalmoscopy.

HistoryA 54-year-old woman presented with typical chest pain during physical
training at the gym. She had a history of hypertension controlled with
hydrochlorothiazide, without any other cardiovascular risk factor and with
neither personal nor family history of ischemic heart disease. She was
postmenopausal and had a long-standing history of migraine headaches without
hormonal or drug therapy. The patient had no history of clinically important
thoracic trauma or invasive chest interventions. Initial electrocardiography
(ECG) showed signs of ongoing anterior ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction, and emergent coronary angiography with angioplasty and intravascular 
US were performed. Maximal level of high-sensitive T troponins was 820 ng/L
(normal, <13 ng/L), while echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular
ejection fraction, with no apparent regional wall motion abnormalities. General
physical examination findings were unremarkable, excluding ligamentous
hyperlaxity and joint instability. C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor,
antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme blood test results were negative. For further
evaluation, arterial phase ECG-synchronized CT angiography from the skull base to
the pubis symphysis was performed.

All over the world there is serious concern about the shortage of organs
available for transplantation. In an effort to address this, transplantation with
grafts, which was previously considered a contraindication, are now performed. In
some cases, this practice has contributed to increasing the organ pool.
Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the second-most-common cause of renovascular
hypertension and is observed in 2%-6.6% of potential live kidney donors. Kidney
with FMD is generally considered to be a contraindication for renal
transplantation because renal artery stenosis may progress after transplantation 
and cause graft loss. Here, we report on a successful case of kidney
transplantation using a graft with FMD of a deceased donor who had multiple
aneurysms in the renal artery.

We present a young patient with no vascular risk factors with a basilar branch
infarction secondary to a shelf-like filling defect of the basilar artery. This
defect was present and unchanged on repeat imaging and determined to be most
consistent with a basilar web. Similar to carotid webs, a basilar web is believed
to be an area of focal intimal fibroplasia that increases the risk of brainstem
infarction. Focal fibroplasia of the posterior circulation should be considered
when evaluating young adults with posterior circulation strokes of otherwise
undetermined cause.

Extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms (EICA) are rare. Incidence is <1% 
of all an arterial aneurysm. This aneurysm being rare but is important because it
is associated with a high risk of neurological thromboembolic events, cranial
nerve compression, and rupture. The causes of the EICA are congenital, trauma
leading to the pseudoaneurysm, atherosclerosis, infections, and fibromuscular
dysplasia. Here, we describe a case report of a 69-year-old female with
progressive enlargement of the right neck mass accompanied by dyspnea on
exertion. The patient had been diagnosed as right EICA and underwent the
endovascular procedure as parent vessel occlusion 4 years ago. There was still
enlargement of the size of the right neck mass and was causing troublesome to the
patient. We performed selective embolization of the various feeders to the mass, 
but after this also, it was still enlarging. Three-dimensional reconstruction of 
the computed tomography scan showed fusiform dilatation of the right proximal
EICA. We made the diagnosis of the thrombosed EICA and hence we planned to
undergo surgical management. We performed removal of the intraluminal thrombus
and ligation of the EICA. The size of the swelling decreased significantly.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a serious
non-atherosclerotic disease, most frequently presenting as an acute coronary
syndrome and affecting female patients. Considering that diagnosis of SCAD is
often elusive, and its interventional treatment is associated to a higher rate of
complications than obstructive atherosclerotic disease, we aim to review all the 
imaging tools currently available for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of this
condition.
RECENT FINDINGS: The developments in both invasive and non-invasive imaging
alternatives to coronary angiography, such as intravascular ultrasound, optical
coherence tomography, and computed coronary angiography, have largely contributed
to appraise the epidemiology of SCAD, understand its causative pathophysiological
mechanisms, and improve our ability to confirm doubtful cases of SCAD.
Intracoronary imaging is also a valuable in deciding the best therapeutic
approach and in guiding interventions in those patients requiring percutaneous
treatment. Furthermore, non-invasive imaging is a key tool in ruling out
significant extracoronary vascular abnormalities which frequently occur in
patients with underlying conditions like fibromuscular dysplasia who develop
SCAD. Main imaging tools employed in SCAD cases could have advantages and
drawbacks. Focusing on different types of SCAD, operators should be able to
choose the best imaging technique for diagnosis, management, and follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is typically diagnosed in young
hypertensive women. The 2014 European FMD Consensus recommended screening in all 
hypertensive women <30 yo. However, the prevalence of renal FMD in
young/middle-aged hypertensive women remains unclear. The aim of this work was to
assess the prevalence and characteristics of renal FMD in hypertensive women ≤50 
yo.
METHODS: We retrospectively included all consecutive women aged ≤50 years
referred to our Hypertension Unit from 2014 to 2017 and collected standardized
information on patient characteristics and screening modalities.
RESULTS: Of 1083 incident hypertensive patients, 157 patients fitted with
inclusion criteria. The prevalence of renal FMD varied between 3.2% in the whole 
sample and 7.5% in patients explored by CTA and/or MRA (n = 67). In the subgroup 
of patients ≤30 yo (n = 32), the corresponding figures were 3.1% and 5.6%. The
yearly prevalence of FMD tended to increase over time, in parallel with increased
use of CTA/MRA as a first-line imaging modality. Out of 5 patients with renal
FMD, 2 were revascularized and 1 had extra-renal FMD.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of renal FMD in young/middle-aged hypertensive women 
is probably one order of magnitude higher than previously assumed, in the range
of 3%-8%, depending on imaging modalities. While the diagnosis of FMD does not
influence short-term management in all patients, it may allow close monitoring
and prevention of complications of the disease over time. This analysis provides 
the rationale for a prospective, multicentre study aiming at determining the
cost-effectiveness of systematic screening for renal FMD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine available clinical data on the differences between 
premenopausal and postmenopausal women with hypertension (HTN). Clinical
conditions related to HTN and reproductive status differ in younger women
compared with older women. Due to recent changes in the definition of HTN, the
prevalence of HTN has increased significantly in all women. Rising rates of
obesity among women of all ages increase the risk for HTN.
RECENT FINDINGS: Among younger women, long-term vascular consequences of
preeclampsia, the under-reported prevalence of fibromuscular dysplasia, and
widespread use of oral contraceptive pills in women with contraindications confer
unique risks for HTN-related cardiovascular risk. For older women, insights on
vascular aging and hormonal changes with menopause are shown to be
gender-specific causal factors for HTN. Assessment of risk factors unique to
premenopausal and postmenopausal women can facilitate the management of HTN and
improve long-term outcomes. Further studies in women are needed to accurately
stratify women risk based on these risk factors.

Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAAs) are the most common peripheral arterial
aneurysms and develop almost exclusively (>90%) in men who have a history of
tobacco abuse at an average age of 65 years. Most PAAs are caused by chronic
inflammation secondary to atherosclerotic disease; other nondegenerative causes
of PAAs include arterial trauma, infection, Behçet's disease, medial
fibromuscular dysplasia, or popliteal artery entrapment. Few case reports have
been published on idiopathic congenital PAAs. We report a case of a 26-year-old
man who presented with progressive claudication and subsequent acute limb
ischemia due to the thrombosis of a large idiopathic PAA. Our case demonstrates
that the differential diagnosis of young adult or pediatric patients presenting
with signs of acute limb ischemia or claudication should include a symptomatic
PAA.

BACKGROUND: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary
hypertension. The most common aetiology is atherosclerosis; however, other causes
like fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and Takayasu arteritis (TA) are also
frequently encountered. The lesion characteristics and its response to
percutaneous intervention depend upon the aetiology of RAS. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) is an excellent imaging modality to analyse coronary lesions
during percutaneous coronary interventions. The data regarding the utility of OCT
in renal artery imaging is limited, consisting of a few case reports.
CASE SUMMARY: We hereby report four cases of RAS, each of different aetiology
(atherosclerotic, FMD, post-transplant, and TA), who underwent OCT imaging of the
renal artery along with percutaneous renal angioplasty.
DISCUSSION: The advantages of OCT imaging include demonstration of the arterial
wall, pathological features of the disease, and to guide percutaneous
interventions. The major limitation of OCT is its lower imaging depth, which may 
render imaging of large vessels difficult.

Background: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) primarily involves medium-sized
arteries, though the entire spectrum of vascular involvement is not fully
understood. We hypothesized that larger arteries may also be affected, albeit
sub-clinically. Patients and methods: We measured the cross-sectional diameter of
the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, common iliac arteries (CIA) and common
carotid arteries (CCA) in FMD subjects and compared them to matched controls. We 
retrospectively analyzed records of FMD subjects (n = 74) and of age- and sex-
matched controls (n = 74) that underwent computed tomography of the neck, chest
or abdomen. Cross-sectional diameters of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, CIA
and CCA were measured in a standardized manner by two trained physicians.
Results: The FMD group had a significantly greater diameter of the CIA and CCA
bilaterally. The measurements (mm) in FMD and control groups were as follows:
Right CIA: 10.85 + 1.75 vs. 10.23 + 1.36, p = 0.04, left CIA: 11.01 + 1.93 vs.
10.15 + 1.38, p = 0.007, right CCA: 7.70 + 0.81 vs. 6.80 + 1.10, p < 0.001 and
left CCA: 7.70 + 1.10 vs. 6.80 + 1.0, p < 0.001). There was no difference in the 
diameter between the two groups in the ascending aorta, descending and the
abdominal aorta. After adjusting for baseline differences, common carotid
arteries (but not common iliac) were significantly larger in FMD group compared
with controls. Conclusions: There is sub-clinical involvement of the common
carotid arteries in patients with FMD and this manifests as a greater diameter of
these arteries compared to age and sex matched controls.

A 31-year-old woman presented at the emergency room after experiencing colic pain
in the right iliac fossa for 5 days. She had previously consulted another center,
where deterioration of renal function had been identified and abdominal computed 
tomography (CT) angiography had shown a dissection of the right renal artery,
with areas suggestive of infarction in the right kidney, as well as an aneurysm
in the left renal artery and a smaller left kidney. The patient had no relevant
family or personal history except posttraumatic carotid-cavernous fistula in
2014, which had been treated with embolization. In our hospital, the patient was 
hypertensive and acute renal failure was confirmed, accompanied by an increase in
lactate dehydrogenase and isomorphic microhematuria. After a new CT Scan, in
addition to the lesions described in the renal arteries, another aneurysm in the 
splenic artery and an aneurysm of the right femoral artery were identified.
Antihypertensive treatment was initiated with calcium antagonists and
anticoagulation. Subsequent renal arteriography confirmed the dissection of the
right renal artery, which could not be repaired, and a coated stent was placed in
the left renal artery to exclude the aneurysm. The splenic artery lesion was
treated 2 months later. The etiological diagnosis in this young woman was
challenging. The presence of visceral aneurysms suggested a differential
diagnosis comprising fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and collagenopathies.
Using a multidisciplinary approach and directed anamnesis, the presence of
frequent sprains, joint hypermobility, and skin fragility was confirmed. Blood
immunology and CT angiography including the thoracic and cervical territories
were normal. Echocardiography revealed tricuspid insufficiency. All these data
suggested the presence of a collagen-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vascular form).
The diagnosis was confirmed by the genetic study, which showed a pathogenic
mutation in the COL3A1 gene. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic with
recovered renal function following treatment with a beta-blocker and antiplatelet
therapy.

Carotid web is a rare risk factor of ischemic stroke. A total of 32 (0.54%)
patients with carotid web were finally diagnosed in 5 943 patients who underwent 
carotid computerized tomography angiography (CTA) in two hospitals. Only one
patient received carotid endarterectomy that pathological findings were fibrous
tissue hyperplasia of vascular wall with mucinous degeneration. Stent
implantation was administrated in two cases. Among 13 asymptomatic patients, the 
observational follow-up period was (20.9±12.4) months without strokes. Carotid
web is a rare aberration. Asymptomatic patients with carotid web are usually

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) are
noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic arterial diseases that cause aneurysm,
occlusion, and thromboses. These diseases are rarely seen in mesenteric arterial 
lesions; however, as they can be lethal if appropriate management is not
provided, the accumulation of clinical information from cases is essential. We
herein report the cases of a 57-year-old man diagnosed with FMD and a 63-year-old
man diagnosed with SAM. We conclude that an early diagnosis with imaging
modalities and clinical information followed by the appropriate treatment
improves the prognosis of these arterial diseases.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare cause of acute
coronary syndrome compared with atherosclerotic plaque rupture and predominantly 
occurs in young women. SCAD is associated with various conditions, such as
emotional stress, pregnancy, hormonal therapy, collagen diseases, fibromuscular
dysplasia, or vasospasm. Long-term cardiovascular events are common including the
recurrence of SCAD. We report a case of SCAD with de novo recurrence at only 4
days after the first attack. <Learning objectives: Spontaneous coronary artery
dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
compared with atherosclerotic plaque rupture, but if young to middle-aged women
develop ACS, a high suspicion of SCAD is warranted. Recurrence of SCAD is common 
with 4- to 10-year follow-up. However, SCAD recurred early as in our case.>.

Carotid artery pseudoaneurysms are infrequently encountered in clinical practice.
Major contributory etiologies include blunt trauma, infections, cystic medial
necrosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, arteriosclerosis, and congenital
abnormalities. The authors report an exceedingly rare case of a dissected
external carotid artery pseudoaneurysm in a 26-year-old female patient with
neurofibromatosis complicated by preeclampsia at 28-week period of gestation,
safely and successfully treated by coil embolization.

Background: Current consensus recommends extended vascular investigation in
patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). We here report our
experience with the use of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for screening
extra-coronary arteriopathy in patients presenting with SCAD.
Methods: Patients presenting with SCAD in a Spanish centre underwent prospective 
contrast-enhanced MRA to assess the cephalic and abdominopelvic arterial
territories. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was diagnosed following European
consensus criteria. Other vascular abnormalities were recorded separately. Two
vascular radiologists supervised the acquisitions and independently analysed the 
results for all cases.
Results: Forty patients with SCAD [mean age 50.9±8.6 years, 90% (n=36) women]
were included in the study, 12 patients declined to participate and 5 were
excluded (metallic implanted devices). All enrolled patients underwent the
screening protocol without complications. MRA demonstrated at least one
extra-coronary vascular abnormality in 16 patients (40%): 5 (12.5%) were
diagnosed with FMD, 6 (15%) showed arterial tortuosity, 3 (7.5%) had non-FMD
focal stenoses, and 2 (5%) were found to have small aneurysms at the celiac trunk
and splenic artery. No intracranial aneurysms were detected. At a mean follow-up 
of 4±3 years from the index episode, two cases experienced SCAD recurrences, one 
in a patient with FMD and the other one in a patient with arterial tortuosity. No
deaths or strokes occurred.
Conclusions: Systematic extended vascular study with MRA was feasible and
demonstrated associated extra-coronary arteriopathy in a substantial proportion
of patients presenting with SCAD; however, none required additional intervention 
or led to vascular events. MRA, being a radiation-free modality, may be the
preferred method for screening extracoronary arteriopathy in SCAD, a condition
primarily affecting young and middle-age women sensitive to the risks of
radiation.

The impact of blood disorders on fibromuscular dysplasia is unknown, and
cardiovascular surgery results are also unclear. Furthermore, there are only a
few case reports about the association between fibromuscular dysplasia and blood 
disorders. We report a case of a coronary bypass surgery and an aortic root
replacement for a patient who is hypereosinophilic with multisite vasculopathy of
fibromuscular dysplasia, including that of the coronary artery and saphenous
vein, which was diagnosed by a histopathologic examination after an autopsy was
performed 5 months after surgery. The outcome of cardiovascular surgery can be
unfavorable for fibromuscular dysplasia. Blood disorders may also have an impact 
on the outcome.

Pediatric hypertension can cause hypertensive emergencies, including hemorrhagic 
stroke, contributing to rare but serious childhood morbidity and mortality.
Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is one of the major causes of secondary
hypertension in children. Grange syndrome (MIM#602531) is a rare disease
characterized by multiple stenosis or occlusion of the renal, abdominal,
coronary, and cerebral arteries, which can cause phenotypes of RVH and
fibromuscular dysplasia (MIM#135580). We report the case of a 7-year-old girl
with Grange syndrome who showed RVH and multiple seizure episodes. At 1 year of
age, she experienced seizures and sequential hemiparesis caused by a left
thalamic hemorrhage without cerebral vascular anomalies. Chronic hypertension was
observed, and abdominal computed tomography angiography showed characteristic
bilateral renal artery stenosis. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel
homozygous pathogenic variant in the YY1AP1 gene (NM_001198903.1: c.1169del:
p.Lys390Argfs*12). Biallelic YY1AP1 mutations are known to cause Grange syndrome.
Unlike previously reported patients, our patient presented with intracerebral
hemorrhagic stroke without anomalous brain artery or bone fragility. The
phenotype in our patient may help better understand this ultra-rare syndrome.
Grange syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with childhood-onset 
hypertension and/or hemorrhagic stroke for early clinical intervention.

BACKGROUND: Secondary hypertension accounts for 5% of all cases of hypertension. 
Renal artery stenosis is one of the common causes of secondary hypertension.
Atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the commonest types of stenosis
associated with renal vascular hypertension, with the former accounting for
70-80% of all cases and the latter accounting for 10% of the incidence. The
greatest incidence atherosclerosis is in men over the age of 40 years, mostly
affecting the proximal part of the renal arteries, whereas fibromuscular
dysplasia affects women ranging in age from 30 to 50 years. Currently, possible
treatments are medical treatment using blood pressure-lowering drugs, balloon
angioplasty with or without stent insertion, and surgery to reconstruct the
artery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old Asian woman with stenosis of
two branches of renal artery bifurcation treated by percutaneous balloon
dilatation and stenting of both branches after referral to our department for a
renal angiogram following 8 months of uncontrolled hypertension despite receiving
medications. Initially, the patient presented with severe headache and fatigue.
She was a known nonsmoker, was not diabetic, and had no history of diabetes in
her family. She had no history of atherosclerosis. Apart from high blood
pressure, the result of her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory
investigations revealed normal serum cholesterol, lipid profile, and serum
creatinine. She had been attending a hypertension clinic and receiving
antihypertensive drugs for the past 8 months on a regular basis under close
observation. Despite this treatment and care, her blood pressure remained high at
175/110 mmHg, which the attending doctor concluded to be uncontrolled blood
pressure. Initial imaging indicated left renal artery stenosis, and the patient
was referred to our department.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite receiving
medications, renal Doppler ultrasound should be included in the diagnostic workup
for secondary hypertension. Once renal artery stenosis is suspected, renal
angiography is highly recommended because the technique is able to accurately
diagnose stenosis in the branch arteries, unlike computed tomographic angiography
and magnetic resonance angiography. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty
is the treatment of choice for renal artery stenosis in patients with
renovascular hypertension or renal dysfunction.

The term "carotid web" was first used in 1973 and is considered a rare form of
fibromuscular dysplasia(FMD). A carotid web was reported to produce thrombus
formation and cause of ischemic events. However, it is rarely reported because of
its low incidence. As for the diagnosis, noninvasive routine radiological
modalities such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography may have
very low sensitivity due to the subtle nature of the entity. Therefore, these
types of lesions may be often underdiagnosed. We describe three cases that
presented with minor and recurrent major ischemic strokes resistant to medical
management. All 3 cases had a good course with no recurrence after carotid
endarterectomy. On pathological examination, all specimens revealed mild
atherosclerotic change, although FMD was known to be a non-inflammatory and
non-atherosclerotic angiopathy. Early detection of a carotid web is highly
important. Three-dimensional CT angiography(3D-CTA)maximum intensity
projection(MIP)imaging seems to be a reliable noninvasive technique, although
catheter angiography is considered as the gold standard. The cases with carotid
web have characteristics such as more recurrent ischemic stroke and resistance to
medical management. Surgical treatment should be considered if medical management
in unsuccessful. Moreover, even if asymptomatic, it might also be considered for 
cases with a growing web or with blood stasis behind the web.

Introduction: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly
appreciated cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death
most often affecting young to middle-aged women with few conventional
cardiovascular risk factors. Areas covered: A literature search was performed
using MedLine, PubMed, and Google Scholar (dating to 04/30/2019). Authors review 
the key clinical features of SCAD and highlight what is known regarding its
pathophysiology and associated factors. The relationship between SCAD and other
systemic vasculopathies, notably fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is also discussed.
Authors also mention the management of acute SCAD along with considerations for
long term follow-up such as chest pain syndrome, extracoronary vasculopathy
screening, and recurrent SCAD. Expert opinion: Our understanding regarding the
association of SCAD and other arteriopathies such as FMD is anticipated to grow. 
In addition, progress is likely to be made in our efforts to predict recurrent
SCAD risk and define potential preventative strategies, possibly through the
incorporation of adjunctive imaging.

BACKGROUND: Nonatherosclerotic abdominal arterial vasculopathies (NAVs),
including mesenteric or renal artery dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, and
vasculitis, are rare but have great clinical significance. Patients may present
emergently with life-threatening complications such as arterial rupture and
hemorrhagic shock. Herein, we present our center's experience with NAVs and
provide extensive literature review to close the gap in the scarce, related
literature.
METHODS: From a single-center retrospective data analysis, we identified and
characterized subjects (aged 18-60 years) who presented with NAV between January 
2000 and December 2015. Of the 1416 charts reviewed, 118 met inclusion criteria.
RESULTS: The average age of patients with NAV was 47.0 ± 9.9 years, mostly
affecting women (64%). Primary diagnoses included fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)
(25.4%), isolated aneurysms (24.6%), and median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) 
(15.3%). Less common diagnoses were localized vasculitis of the gastrointestinal 
tract (LVGT) (7.6%), isolated dissection (5.1%), microscopic polyangiitis and
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (5.1%), trauma (4.2%), segmental arterial
mediolysis (4.2%), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (2.5%), Takayasu's arteritis (2.5%),
polyarteritis nodosa (1.7%), idiopathic abdominal aortitis (0.8%), and
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (0.8%). Females constituted 90% of patients with FMD, 77.8% 
with MALS, 77.8% with isolated aneurysms, 66.7% with Takayasu arteritis, and
55.6% with LVGT. Prevalent comorbidities included tobacco use (43.6%) and
hypertension (52.1%). Coil embolization was used in 14.4%, anticoagulation in
11.9%, angioplasty/stenting in 11.9%, open resection/surgical revascularization
in 10.2%, and prednisone in 10.2% of the cases. Conservative management was
pursued in 33.1% of the patients. A high degree of symptom relief was shown in
91.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: NAV are rare and can be caused by different etiologies that
primarily affect females. Hypertension and tobacco use were prevalent. Various
imaging strategies revealed aneurysms, stenosis, dissection, and/or thrombosis
affecting renal and celiac arteries. Most patients improved with conservative,
medical, endovascular, or surgical approach. More research is needed to
standardize management approach to patients with NAV.

BACKGROUND: Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) may reflect a systemic dysplastic
arteriopathy, independent of a recognized connective tissue disease. It is
hypothesized that RAAs are associated with an increased risk of intracranial
aneurysms (IcAs). The objective of this study was to better define the
association of IcAs in women with RAAs.
METHODS: Women aged 20 to 60 years who presented with RAAs at the University of
Michigan from 2001 to 2016 were included in the study. Their clinical status and 
radiologic images were retrospectively reviewed, with particular attention
directed to the prevalence of IcAs. Phenotypic characteristics predictive of
associated cerebrovascular lesions were assessed using various statistical
analyses, including binomial logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 83 women with RAAs, the average age at the time of RAA detection
was 45.3 ± 9.9 years (range, 20-60 years). Hypertension affected 56 (67.5%)
patients and poorly controlled hypertension prompted imaging for suspected renal 
arterial disease in 12 (14.5%) patients. Multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia
occurred in 12 (14.8%) of patients, and unifocal stenosis affected 7 (8.4%)
patients. Imaging of the intracranial vasculature (n = 31) documented 12
aneurysms in 9 women, with the cavernous internal carotid artery being the most
commonly affected artery. Among the study's patients, 20 (24.1%) had an "at-risk 
disorder for IcA formation," although the frequency of relevant "at-risk
disorders" in those with and without IcAs was not statistically different
(P = 0.21). Rupture risk defined by PHASES score was less than 1% for 10 IcAs,
but 2 IcAs carried a 2.4% and 7.2% rupture risk, respectively, over a 5-year time
period. Surgical management was pursued in 6 (50%) of the study's IcAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting RAAs and IcAs may reflect a systemic arteriopathy. IcAs
appear to occur with greater frequency in women with RAAs than the general
population. This observation warrants prospective investigation as to the
clinical appropriateness and relevance of cerebrovascular imaging in women with
RAAs. Furthermore, this study's findings prompt further investigation of the
underlying pathogenesis of what appears to be a broader and more complex arterial
disease than previously recognized.

Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed
and rare cause of myocardial infarction (MI). SCAD is defined as the separation
of the coronary artery wall by hemorrhage with or without intimal tear. It causes
acute coronary syndrome in 1.7% to 4% of cases.
Case Summary: We report a case of a patient with acute MI caused by SCAD with
marked progression of dissection within 4 days and spontaneous healing in 2
months. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the arteries is an associated condition 
of SCAD that was found in our patient.
Conclusion: In young women admitted to the clinic with signs of acute myocardial 
infarction, SCAD should be suspected. FMD as an associated condition that should 
be ruled out in every SCAD patient. Conservative treatment of SCAD is the most
preferable strategy.

BACKGROUND: Stroke occurs more often and results in more severe brain injury in
African Americans than in Caucasians. The former also exhibit different responses
to thrombolytic therapy than the latter do. There is an imminent need for stroke 
biomarkers for African Americans, who have been underrepresented in biomarker
research for stroke diagnosis and prognosis. Proteomics offers sources for
protein biomarkers that are not available by other Omics approaches. In this
pilot study, plasma proteomes of African American stroke patients were analyzed
and compared to that of hypertensive, non-stroke controls.
METHODS: Plasma samples were prepared from whole blood specimens that were
collected from stroke patients admitted to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta,
and their age- and sex-matched, hypertensive controls from the outpatient clinic.
Samples were pooled according to patient groups and sex. Plasma proteins were
analyzed with quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified and quantified
proteins were compared between stroke and control patients of each sex. Proteins 
that showed changes in abundances in stroke patients were further analyzed with
the assistance of bioinformatics tools for their known biological functions or
potential implications in stroke.
RESULTS: A total of 128 annotated proteins were identified. Results of
bioinformatic analysis of plasma proteins whose levels were increased in stroke
patients showed, as expected, their association with blood coagulation and
inflammation processes. Interestingly, a number of proteins showed different or
even opposing changes in male and female stroke patients, notably those involved 
in IL-4 and IL-6 signaling, complement activation, and blood coagulation
disorders. For a few proteins that were increased in female but unchanged or
decreased in male stroke patients, an association with fibromuscular dysplasia
was recognized.
CONCLUSION: Plasma proteins that differ in quantities between stroke patients and
controls were readily detected using a simple proteomic approach. Sex-dependent
changes and changes that have not been reported for African American stroke
patients offer potentially novel biomarkers for stroke in this underserved
population.

Vertebral artery (VA) dissection is one major cause of brain infarction in young 
and middle-aged adults. Risk factors for VA dissection are hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidemia, trauma, and genetic factors. A 32-year-old man with
familial Hirschsprung disease at the age of 2 presented cerebellar ischemic
stroke due to bilateral VA dissections. A stroke recurred within 17 days despite 
oral dual antiplatelet therapy. Bilateral VA dissections and recurrent
dissections are related to genetic mutations associated with connective tissue
diseases. A part of familial Hirschsprung disease has genetic factors in common
with cerebrovascular disease. There may be a common genetic background between
his VA dissection and Hirschsprung disease.

Background The goal of this study is to report the characteristics and long-term 
clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) 
and to identify factors associated with recurrent SCAD . Methods and Results This
is a retrospective cohort study that included patients who underwent coronary
angiography for evaluation of acute myocardial infarction between 2006 and 2016. 
Among 26 598 patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial
infarction, 208 (0.78%) were diagnosed with SCAD . Patients with SCAD were
younger (49.0±11.6 versus 65.6±12.2 years) and more likely to be women (88.9%
versus 31.6%). Atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, were less prevalent. Median
follow-up was 4.7 years. Mortality was lower in patients with SCAD (1-year
mortality: 2.4% versus 8.8%; P<0.001). After using propensity score matching to
control for differences in age, sex, and comorbidities, the difference in
mortality was no longer present, suggesting that lower mortality in patients with
SCAD is attributed primarily to their baseline characteristics. Recurrent SCAD
occurred in 22 patients (10.6%). Multivariate Cox regression modeling showed
concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (hazard ratio, 5.1; 95% CI , 1.6-15.8;
P=0.005) and migraine headaches (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI , 1.4-8.4; P=0.008) to
be associated with increased risk of recurrent SCAD . Conclusions Among patients 
with acute myocardial infarction, patients with SCAD have a lower risk of
mortality, which is attributed primarily to their younger age, female sex, and
low prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors. Risk of recurrent SCAD persists
years after the initial presentation. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and
migraine are at higher risk for recurrent SCAD .

INTRODUCTION Data on the assessment of intrarenal blood flow parameters in
patients with renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are scarce. OBJECTIVES The aim 
of the study was to evaluate intrarenal blood flow parameters in patients with
FMD and significant or nonsignificant renal artery stenosis (RAS). PATIENTS AND
METHODS We evaluated intrarenal blood flow parameters by Doppler ultrasonography 
in 153 patients with renal FMD enrolled in the ARCADIA‑POL study: 32 and 121
patients with and without significant RAS, respectively, compared with 60 matched
patients with essential hypertension and 60 healthy controls. RESULTS Patients
with FMD and significant RAS had a lower renal resistive index (RRI) compared
with patients with FMD without significant RAS, patients with essential
hypertension, and normotensive controls (mean [SD], 0.51 [0.08] vs 0.60 [0.07],
0.62 [0.06], and 0.61 [0.06], respectively; P <0.001). In patients with
nonsignificant RAS, RRI correlated significantly with carotid intima-media
thickness, 24‑hour diastolic blood pressure, 24‑hour pulse pressure, left
ventricular diastolic function, known duration time of hypertension, and age. In 
patients with significant RAS, there was a significant correlation between RRI
and known duration time of hypertension, left ventricular diastolic function, and
age. In a separate, "per‑kidney" analysis, renal arteries with FMD and
significant RAS were characterized by lower RRI values, higher maximal blood flow
velocity, higher renal aortic ratio, and longer acceleration time compared with
renal arteries with FMD and nonsignificant RAS as well as renal arteries without 
FMD. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to atherosclerotic RAS, intrarenal blood flow in
patients with FMD and RAS is preserved, confirming that renal vasculature is
relatively intact in these patients.

A 54-year-old woman with no prior coronary artery disease or cardiac risk factors
was diagnosed with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) after presenting
with an acute coronary syndrome. Over the next 5 years, she experienced four more
episodes of SCAD, involving different coronary artery distributions, with
evidence of complete angiographic healing following conservative management with 
antiplatelet therapy and beta-blockade.

Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent and
often misdiagnosis of a non-atherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome
(ACS). It is an important cause of ACS in young women, responsible for up to 25% 
of all cases in women <50 years of age without cardiovascular risk factors.
Clinical presentation ranges from ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (MI)
to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The treatment of patients with SCAD
is a challenge and the ideal management strategy has yet to be determined.
Case summary: A 42-year-old woman without family history of cardiac disease and
neither traditional atherosclerotic risk factors presented to our centre with an 
anterior acute ST-segment-elevation MI secondary to multiple spontaneous
dissections of the left main, anterior descending, and ramus intermedius coronary
arteries. Stenting was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery 
and left main coronary artery to resolve its occlusion. Fibromuscular dysplasia
was confirmed via computed tomography angiography.
Discussion: More cases are now being identified of SCAD due to increased clinical
index of suspicion, earlier use of invasive angiography, and intracoronary
imaging in patients presenting with acute chest pain. Despite this, the absence
of previous cardiovascular risk factors and the ignorance of this pathology delay
the start of an adequate medical treatment and the performance of a cardiac
catheterization. Prognostic data are limited, partly because of its
underdiagnosis and lack of prospective studies, so its knowledge is necessary to 
improve the prognosis of these patients.

Background: We present a patient with history of sinus venous thrombosis and
hypertension during the last year. Her blood pressure was not controlled despite 
drugs, diet, and exercise. She denied symptoms. She does not smoke nor drink
alcohol. Her body mass index was 20 kg/m2, NYHA Class I/IV.
Case summary: A 40-year-old Latin-American female patient, concerned because
despite taking verapamil 160 mg/day, losartan 100 mg/day, and hydrochlorothiazide
25 mg/day her diastolic blood pressure was over 100 mmHg. Routine serum and urine
lab tests and a transthoracic echocardiogram were done and were normal. The
treatment was increased over the next consultations but without control of her
blood pressure. She developed resistant hypertension, and she was taking four
antihypertensive drugs and two diuretics. A first renal artery Doppler was
normal. Because of a high clinical suspicion a renal angio-CT was performed
showing bilateral fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient underwent a renal artery
angioplasty with balloon with excellent results and better control of her blood
pressure after the procedure. Over the next month, her doctors were able to
decrease her treatment to two drugs at intermediate doses. Currently, she is
doing well and asymptomatic.
Discussion: Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) could be a challenging
disease to be diagnosed. Patients with this condition may suffer from symptomatic
and resistant hypertension. Many patients do not have abnormalities on their
physical exam or in the routine lab tests. Treatment includes renal artery
angioplasty if patient is symptomatic and blood pressure is resistant.

Background: Carotid webs are luminal, shelf-like protrusions at the carotid bulb.
Considered to be a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, carotid webs have been
observed principally in African American females. The association between carotid
webs and recurrent ischemic strokes continues to be established as patients
without traditional stroke risk factors are found to have carotid webs as the
only possible cause of symptomatic deficits. The majority of patients undergo
endarterectomy; few stent placements are reported. We present the case of an
African American female who underwent stent placement for treatment and secondary
prevention of stroke attributed to a carotid web. Case Report: A 33-year-old
African American female presented with acute onset left hemiparesis and left
facial droop. Alteplase was administered; multiphase head and neck computed
tomography angiography revealed an occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery 
with a web at the carotid bulb. Aspiration catheter thrombectomy achieved a
Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 3. She was placed on 2
antiplatelet agents, and 3 weeks later she underwent stent placement. Follow-up
digital subtraction angiography at 3 months showed obliteration of the right
carotid artery web and satisfactory integration of the stent into the vessel
wall. She was reassessed at 1 year and reported no neurologic symptoms.
Conclusion: Although carotid webs are most commonly treated with endarterectomy, 
they may be amenable to stent therapy with favorable clinical outcomes as shown
with this patient.

Secondary hypertension accounts for 5% to 10% of all hypertensive cases, and
renal artery stenosis is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension.
Although atherosclerotic vascular disease and fibromuscular dysplasia are the
leading causes of renal artery stenosis, there are other, rare etiologies, such
as vasculitis and trauma. A partial nephrectomy is the standard of care treatment
option for early stage renal carcinoma patients. Traumatic renal artery stenosis 
can occur during this surgical intervention, though it is a very rare adverse
event, and only a few case reports have been reported in the literature. This
report is the description of successful percutaneous treatment of accelerated
hypertension secondary to traumatic renal artery stenosis after a partial
nephrectomy.

INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) accounts for up to 4%
of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) on coronary angiography and predominantly
affects women (>90%). SCAD most often occurs in patients with few or no
conventional cardiovascular risk factors. This condition remains underdiagnosed
due to a lack of awareness among health-care providers and misdiagnosis on
coronary angiography. Areas covered: In this review, authors aim to summarize
contemporary data on the etiology, morbidity and mortality risks, as well as
management strategies in order to raise awareness. Expert opinion: The last
decade of extensive research revealed that SCAD is not as rare as previously
thought and needs to be in the differential diagnosis of all MI patients,
especially in young to middle-aged women. Predisposing factors, such as
fibromuscular dysplasia, and potential triggers like physical or emotional
stresses, are frequently linked. Coronary angiography is the first-line
diagnostic tool and should be performed meticulously because of more fragile
vessel architecture to avoid iatrogenic dissections. If angiographic findings are
uncertain, the use of intravascular imaging may be required. Conservative therapy
is favored over revascularization unless patients have high-risk features.
Recurrent cardiovascular events post-SCAD are frequent, and patients should be
closely monitored after a SCAD event.

An asymptomatic 54-year-old Caucasian female was found to have a right carotid
bruit located high in the cervical region. Carotid duplex ultrasound revealed
carotid intimal disease with increased Doppler flow in the mid-distal right
internal carotid artery (RICA) with color Doppler turbulence in the distal RICA. 
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a typical "string-of-beads" sign
in both distal internal carotid artery (ICAs), diagnostic of fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD). While often not diagnostic, carotid duplex ultrasound may yield 
clues as to diagnosis of FMD with elevated Doppler velocity in the distal
carotid, turbulent distal carotid flow, and possibly a "string-of-beads" sign. An
"S-curve" distal ICA is associated with FMD and may warrant further evaluation.
Magnetic resonance angiography and CTA appear to be better for diagnosis of
carotid FMD. The typical "string-of-beads" may be readily identified. While
invasive angiography is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis of carotid
FMD, it is infrequently required. Generally, invasive angiography is performed in
symptomatic patients in planning for interventional therapy.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of myocardial
infarction and sudden cardiac death, particularly in young to middle-aged women. 
Coronary vasospasm is another condition believed to be associated with SCAD;
however, this has only been shown in isolated case reports to date. We sought to 
examine the association of SCAD and coronary vasospasm by reporting the
experience of coronary vasospasm testing in patients with a history of previous
SCAD in a large, tertiary referral center. We conducted a single-center
retrospective review of patients with history of SCAD confirmed by angiography
who received provocative testing using ergonovine in the Cleveland Clinic cardiac
catheterization lab from January 1990 to December 2016. Positive vasospasm was
defined as: (1) total or subtotal occlusion of at least 1 major coronary artery
induced by administration of ergonovine and (2) resolution of said occlusion with
the administration of nitrates. Patients with history of strong trauma to the
chest and iatrogenic dissection (e.g., catheter-induced) were excluded from the
study. We identified 11 patients who satisfied all inclusion criteria. All
participants were women and the mean age was 47 years: 73% received screening for
fibromuscular dysplasia and of those, 38% were found to have the diagnosis. Only 
1 of 11 patients had a positive vasospasm test in the setting of ergonovine
administration in the catheterization lab. In conclusion, we found a low
prevalence of coronary vasospasm in individuals with confirmed previous SCAD.

We discuss the case of a 27-month-old girl afflicted with fibromuscular
dysplasia. She presented with hemiatrophy of left upper and lower limbs, nail
dystrophy, ulcers on the tips of her toes, cold and painful limbs, foot drop, and
hypertension. The initial appearance started at 2 months of age and other
diagnoses such as complex regional pain syndrome, reflex sympathetic syndrome,
vasculitis and coagulation disorders had been considered. Angiography revealed
that all the arterial branches of the left lower and upper limbs, from brachial
to ulnar and radial, and from iliac and femoral to tibialis arteries were
affected. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. In the follow-up visits
until 2 years after the patient's discharge she did not develop any new problem
and her blood pressure was controlled by enalapril and amlodipine.

Purpose: Carotid web (CaW) is an underrecognized cause of cryptogenic stroke in
young patients. The optimal imaging for CaW is unknown. We aim to evaluate the
diagnostic accuracy of diverse imaging modalities for the diagnosis of CaW.
Methods: Retrospective analysis of institutional neurovascular database was
performed to identify patients with multimodal (CT angiogram-CTA, digital
subtraction angiogram-DSA, and/or ultrasound-US) imaging diagnosis of CaW or
atherosclerosis. Baseline clinical demographics were recorded. Blinded image
analysis was performed for each imaging modality by separate readers.
Discrepancies were settled by consensus. Two-sided Cohen's Kappa (κ) coefficient 
was used to evaluate the inter-rater agreement for the etiological diagnosis
between imaging modalities. Results: Thirty patients/60 carotids were evaluated
by CTA and 55 carotids were included. Patients with symptomatic CaW (n = 20),
compared to individuals with atherosclerosis (n = 10), were younger (49 ± 9 vs.
60 ± 8 years; p < 0.01), more commonly female (75% vs. 30%; p = 0.01), and less
frequently presented vascular risk factors: Hypertension (40% vs. 100%; p <
0.01), hyperlipidemia (0% vs. 50%; p < 0.01), diabetes (10% vs. 40%; p = 0.05),
and smoking (5% vs. 70%; p < 0.01). High inter-rater correlation strength existed
for CTA (n = 55; κ = 0.88; p < 0.0001) and DSA (n = 28; κ = 0.86, p < 0.0001)
readers for lesion diagnosis while US inter-rater agreement was lower (κ = 0.553;
p = 0.001). Across modalities CTA and DSA shared very high strength of agreement 
(κ = 0.92; p < 0.0001), compared to a less pronounced agreement between US and
CTA (κ = 0.553; p = 0.001). The strength of correlation between DSA-CTA was
significantly more robust as compared to US-CTA (Z = 3.58; p = 0.0003).
Conclusion: CTA and DSA demonstrated comparable and superior performance as
compared to US in the diagnosis of CaW.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Simultaneous dissection of three or four cervical
arteries rarely occurs. As a result, limited information is available on clinical
characteristics, underlying causes, treatment, and outcome of these patients.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review of individual patient data on triple
and quadruple cervical artery dissection (CeAD). We included all cases for whom, 
at minimum, data on age, sex and affected cervical arteries were available.
RESULTS: Out of 1396 publications identified in the initial search, 52 were
included, with data available on 96 patients. Mean age was 42 years and 66% were 
women. 63% had triple CeAD. The most common manifestations were headache (69%),
neck pain (44%), motor deficit (36%), and Horner syndrome (34%). 57% had an
ischemic stroke, in the majority of these patients the stroke was confined to the
vascular territory of a single artery. 83% were managed medically (antiplatelets 
or anticoagulants) and 11% underwent endovascular treatment. An underlying
disease or triggering event was identified in 71%, most commonly trauma (35%,
cervical manipulative therapy in 13%), infection (18%), fibromuscular dysplasia
(16%), and hereditary connective tissue disorder (8%). In-hospital mortality was 
1%. 80% of patients had a good functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at follow-up. Two
recurrences (3%) were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: Triple or quadruple CeAD mostly affected young women, and underlying
disease or triggering event could be identified in more than two-thirds of
patients. Less than two-thirds of triple or quadruple CeAD patients suffered
ischemic stroke. Most patients were managed medically and the majority had a
favorable outcome.

We describe a case of concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and
atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) disease in a symptomatic patient.
Sixty-eight-year-old female presented for evaluation of a transient ischemic
attack. Imaging revealed severe proximal >80% ICA stenosis with severe FMD to mid
and distal ICA. Planned hybrid approach with left carotid endarterectomy (CEA)
and balloon angioplasty was aborted intraoperatively due to lack of back
bleeding. Open gradual rigid dilation was then performed with resumption of back 
bleeding. Completion angiogram revealed widely patent flow through CEA patch with
no residual defects. Patient awoke from operation neurologically intact. At
6-month follow-up, carotid duplex revealed severe recurrent ICA stenosis.
Endovascular intervention was performed with balloon dilation to the proximal and
mid-ICA with stenting of a moderate 60% ostial common carotid stenosis. She
recovered well from procedure with 3-month carotid duplex showing widely patent
common carotid stent and ICA with no areas of stenosis. Informed consent has been
obtained from the patient for publication of the case report and accompanying
images.

In this article, we report the autopsy findings of a 23-year-old woman, who was
found unconscious at home by her relatives. During the transportation to the
hospital, the woman was handed over to the ambulance personnel, who were the
first to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the hospital, after an
hour-lasting asystole, the heart activity was restored. Prolonged cardiac arrest 
led to hypoxic brain injury, which resulted in a persistent coma. Examinations
carried out during hospitalization detected hypokinetic interventricular septum, 
frequent ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular fibrillation. The patient died
within 35 hours of admission to the hospital. Gross findings of the heart
included a noticeable increase of the adipose tissue in the right ventricular
wall, where histologically focal myocardial atrophy with focal transmural
lipomatosis reaching endocardium were detected. Death was attributed to
arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy. Pathogenic variants in JUP gene and
KCNH2 gene confirmed the diagnosis. Other finding of note was fibromuscular
dysplasia of ostial right main coronary artery causing a significant luminal
narrowing.

OBJECTIVES: Given the uncertainty regarding the degree and prevalence of
spontaneous healing following spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), the 
aim of this study was to assess the angiographic characteristics of the dissected
segments in a large cohort of patients with SCAD who underwent subsequent repeat 
coronary angiography.
BACKGROUND: SCAD is an uncommon yet important cause of myocardial infarction in
women. Very little is known about the characteristics of healing of dissected
arteries.
METHODS: Patients with nonatherosclerotic SCAD followed prospectively at
Vancouver General Hospital who underwent repeat angiography were included in this
study. Those who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for SCAD were
excluded. Baseline patient demographics and in-hospital and long-term
cardiovascular events were recorded. Angiographic characteristics of the SCAD
artery at index and repeat angiography were assessed by 2 experienced
angiographers. Criteria for angiographic healing were as follows: 1) improvement 
of stenosis severity from index event; 2) residual stenosis <50%; and 3) TIMI
(Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 3.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients with 182 noncontiguous SCAD lesions were 
included. The mean age was 51.5 ± 8.7 years, 88.5% were women, 83.3% were
Caucasian, and 75.6% had fibromuscular dysplasia. All patients presented with
myocardial infarction. At index angiography, type 2 SCAD was most commonly
observed, in 126 of 182 lesions (69.2%); TIMI flow grade <3 was present in 85 of 
182 (46.7%); and median lesion stenosis was 79.0% (interquartile range: 56.0% to 
100%). Median time to repeat angiography was 154 days (interquartile range: 70 to
604 days), with median residual lesion stenosis improving to 25.5% (interquartile
range: 12.0 to 38.8 days), and TIMI flow grade <3 observed in 10 of 182 lesions
(5.5%). Angiographic healing occurred in 157 of 182 lesions (86.3%). Of repeat
angiography performed ≥30 days post-SCAD, 152 of 160 (95%) showed spontaneous
angiographic healing.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of coronary arteries affected by SCAD heal
spontaneously on repeat angiography, with apparent time dependency, with the vast
majority having complete healing after 30 days from the SCAD event.

Fibromuscular dysplasia affects the muscles of small and medium-sized arteries.
The aetiology of the condition is unknown; it is most frequently seen in
middle-aged women, but can affect both sexes at any age. Hypertension is the most
common clinical manifestation when the renal arteries are affected. The diagnosis
is made based on clinical suspicion and specific angiographic findings. The
treatment is aimed at normalisation of blood pressure with the aid of drugs or
through revacularisation.

Introduction: With significant advances in the area of interventional radiology, 
angioplasty and stenting have become preferred first-line treatment in patients
with significant renal artery stenosis. However, not all patients have favorable 
anatomy to undergo minimally invasive treatments, and reconstruction of the renal
artery is an option. In select cases, either improved renal function or
maintenance of existing function and sometimes resolution of hypertension can
follow surgical treatment.
Material and Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted from
August 2010 to June 2016. Patients <45 years of age with uncontrolled
hypertension secondary to renovascular hypertension (RVH) and refractory to
medical management and renal arterial disease unfavorable for percutaneous
intervention were included in the study. All patients were evaluated thoroughly
using computed tomography angiography and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid
renal scan. Patients underwent autotransplantation either into the right or left 
iliac fossa. Some kidneys required bench reconstruction of the renal artery
and/or its branches before being implanted into either iliac fossa.
Results: Nine patients were included in the study. The mean age was 27 years.
Seven were males and two were females. Five patients had bilateral renal artery
stenosis. After autotransplantation, initially five patients became free of
antihypertensive medicines, but on the follow-up, two patients showed rising
trend of blood pressure. The evaluation revealed narrowing at anastomosis site in
both patients with salvageable kidney function in one patient. Angioplasty with
stenting was done in this patient while the second patient underwent secondary
nephrectomy. At 2 years of follow-up, four patients required no antihypertensive 
medicines.
Conclusion: Autotransplantation can be a successful treatment of severe RVH and
should be considered in patients with renal arterial disease unfavorable for
percutaneous intervention.

The complex anatomy of the carotid space within a small confined area is unique
to the head and neck and allows for a vast array of pathology. This paper will
review the anatomy of the carotid space from the skull base to the thorax,
defining its borders at multiple levels, as well as its contents. The paper will 
also describe the myriad of mass lesions and vascular pathologies that may occur 
within the carotid space. The discussion will include anatomic considerations in 
differential diagnoses, imaging features, and lesion characteristics across
multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and conventional
angiography. Entities discussed include paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors,
meningioma, fibromuscular dysplasia, carotidynia, thrombus, dissection,
pseudoaneurysm, and pathology of the deep cervical chain lymph nodes.
Understanding the complex and unique anatomy of the carotid space, as well as the
nuances of navigating a broad differential, will empower the reader to make an
accurate diagnosis.

Visceral aneurysms are rare entities, with a reported incidence of 0.01-2%.
Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory artery disease, 
which may predispose to aneurysmal degeneration. Schizophrenia has been linked to
an increased cardiovascular risk because of the influence of traditional and
disease-specific risk factors. We report the case of a 44-year-old male
schizophrenic patient presenting with a ruptured giant aneurysm of superior
mesenteric artery, managed by mesenteric ligation. The histologic diagnosis was
fibromuscular dysplasia. Another case of visceral aneurysm in schizophrenic
patient with similar histologic features has been previously reported in
literature.

The association between fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and spontaneous cervical
artery dissection (SCeAD) has been recognized, but the available evidence on this
relationship is scant. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to
systematically evaluate FMD frequency, clinical characteristics and vascular bed 
involvement in patients with SCeAD. Among 230 patients referred to the
ARCADIA-POL study, 43 patients (mean age 44.1 ± 8.9 years; 15 men and 28 women)
with SCeAD were referred. Also, 135 patients with FMD were compared to patients
with and without SCeAD. Patients underwent: ambulatory blood pressure
measurements, biochemical evaluation, echocardiographic examination, and whole
body computed tomographic angiography. FMD changes were found in 39.5% of
patients with SCeAD. There were no differences in clinical characteristics
between patients with SCeAD and FMD and those without FMD, except for a tendency 
towards a higher female ratio in SCeAD patients with FMD. There were no
differences in other parameters describing target organ and SCeAD
characteristics. Patients with SCeAD and FMD compared to those without SCeAD were
characterized by a lower frequency of hypertension and a higher frequency of
hyperlipidemia and history of contraceptive hormone use. Our study indicates a
high incidence (39.5%) of FMD in subjects with SCeAD. Since there are no
distinctive discriminating factors between patients with SCeAD and FMD and those 
without FMD, FMD should be suspected in all patients with SCeAD.

Intraesophageal aortopulmonary collateral artery occlusion in an infant with
Tetralogy of Fallot and flow-dependent major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.

Lawson KL, Wong V, Finn JP, Fishbein GA.

Patients with flow-dependent aortopulmonary collateral arteries often exhibit
tenuous clinical statuses. Here we present an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot
with pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries
(MAPCAs) who experienced clinically significant oxygen desaturations during
feedings. These frequent episodes were attributed to gastroesophageal reflux. In 
preparation for possible surgical correction of her complex congenital heart
condition, she was intubated for a cardiac catheterization to better characterize
her anatomy, but terminally decompensated shortly after extubation and restarting
feeding. On autopsy, very mild evidence of esophageal reflux was present;
instead, one of her four aortopulmonary collateral arteries was unexpectedly
discovered traversing through the muscular layer of her esophageal wall. This
finding was confirmed microscopically with significant intimal hyperplasia
compared to uninvolved collateral arteries. The remainder of the autopsy
findings, including her myocardium, lungs, and esophagus, were unremarkable.
Given the feeding-associated oxygen desaturations present in life and the
aberrant collateral artery's comparative stenosis at death, we speculate that the
repetitive trauma of esophageal peristalsis was not only significant enough to
temporarily impact oxygenation but, over time, led to near-occlusion of the
intraesophageal collateral artery, which may have contributed to the terminal
decompensation of this already tenuous patient.

We describe a data repository on heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) 
assembled by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging
(NIA) Intramural Research Program between 2001 and 2013. Participants included
affected persons with a wide range of heritable connective tissue phenotypes, and
unaffected family members. Elements include comprehensive history and physical
examination, standardized laboratory data, physiologic measures and imaging,
standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and an extensive linked
biorepository. The NIA made a commitment to make the repository available to
extramural investigators and deposited samples at Coriell Tissue Repository
(N = 126) and GenTAC registry (N = 132). The clinical dataset was transferred to 
Penn State University College of Medicine Clinical and Translational Science
Institute in 2016, and data elements inventoried. The consented cohort of 1,009
participants averaged 39 ± 18 years (mean ± SD, range 2-95) at consent; gender
distribution is 71% F and 83% self-report Caucasian ethnicity. Diagnostic
categories include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (classical N = 50, hypermobile N = 99, 
vascular N = 101, rare types and unclassified N = 178), Marfan syndrome (N = 33),
Stickler syndrome (N = 60), fibromuscular dysplasia (N = 135), Other HDCT
(N = 72). Unaffected family members (N = 218) contributed DNA for the molecular
archive only. We aim to develop further discrete data from unstructured elements,
analyze multisymptom HDCT manifestations, encourage data use by other researchers
and thereby better understand the complexity of these high-morbidity conditions
and their multifaceted effects on affected persons.

AIMS: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) was underdiagnosed and poorly
understood for decades. It is increasingly recognized as an important cause of
myocardial infarction (MI) in women. We aimed to assess the natural history of
SCAD, which has not been adequately explored.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study
of patients with non-atherosclerotic SCAD presenting acutely from 22 centres in
North America. Institutional ethics approval and patient consents were obtained. 
We recorded baseline demographics, in-hospital characteristics,
precipitating/predisposing conditions, angiographic features (assessed by core
laboratory), in-hospital major adverse events (MAE), and 30-day major adverse
cardiovascular events (MACE). We prospectively enrolled 750 SCAD patients from
June 2014 to June 2018. Mean age was 51.8 ± 10.2 years, 88.5% were women (55.0%
postmenopausal), 87.7% were Caucasian, and 33.9% had no cardiac risk factors.
Emotional stress was reported in 50.3%, and physical stress in 28.9% (9.8%
lifting >50 pounds). Predisposing conditions included fibromuscular dysplasia
31.1% (45.2% had no/incomplete screening), systemic inflammatory diseases 4.7%,
peripartum 4.5%, and connective tissue disorders 3.6%. Most were treated
conservatively (84.3%), but 14.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention
and 0.7% coronary artery bypass surgery. In-hospital composite MAE was 8.8%;
peripartum SCAD patients had higher in-hospital MAE (20.6% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.023). 
Overall 30-day MACE was 8.8%. Peripartum SCAD and connective tissue disease were 
independent predictors of 30-day MACE.
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection predominantly affects women
and presents with MI. Despite majority of patients being treated conservatively, 
survival was good. However, significant cardiovascular complications occurred
within 30 days. Long-term follow-up and further investigations on management are 
warranted.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) represents around 25% of cases of
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in women aged 40-65 years who have few or no
traditional cardiovascular risk factors. It is assumed that the incidence is
underestimated, as the angiographic appearance of SCAD may often mimic
atherosclerosis. This review aims to examine SCAD by focusing on the associated
predisposing factors and precipitating stressors in this heterogeneous patient
population, as well as the best treatment approach and the prognosis. Progressive
knowledge has improved our current understanding of SCAD, but more awareness
among clinicians is necessary. Recently, two position papers from the European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have been
released, which will be summarised in brief.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is defined by focal narrowing of small and
medium-sized arteries due to an idiopathic, noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic
vascular disease. The population-based prevalence of FMD remains unknown. Using
the National Inpatient Sample database, we evaluated the prevalence, clinical
presentation, mortality, and associated conditions of FMD from January 1, 2004,
to September 30, 2015. Among 2,420 patients who presented with FMD, 2,086
(86.20%) of patients were female. The mean age was 55.18 ± 18.99 years in men and
63.37 ± 17.10 years in women. FMD patients most commonly presented with
hypertension (67.3%), transient ischemic attack (3.7%), headache (2.1%),
dizziness (1.1%), abdominal pain (0.6%), or hematuria (0.3%). In-hospital
mortality of FMD patients was 0.74%. In conclusion, FMD is a rare condition with 
low in-hospital mortality that may be considered among female patients presenting
with hypertension.

BACKGROUND: We report a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
secondary to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) complicated by intradialytic
hypertension (IDH). Increased sympathetic drive leading to increased stroke
volume and/or vasoconstriction with an inappropriate increase in peripheral
vascular resistance (PVR) has been postulated to be the cause of IDH.
CASE PRESENTATION: Attempts to control her blood pressure by reducing her goal
weight; increasing dialysis times/ frequency and decreasing her sodium
concentrate in the dialysis fluid were unsuccessful. Acting upon literature
evidence suggesting renovascular disease as a cause of IDH, we referred her to an
interventional radiologist for evaluation of the renal arteries. Selective
angiogram of both renal arteries revealed right sided atherosclerotic renal
artery stenosis (RAS) treated with insertion of a balloon mounted 6 mm stent and 
left sided fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) treated with 5 mm balloon angioplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for interrogating the renal arteries
radiologically for a potential cause in difficult to control IDH and comments on 
the association between PKD and FMD that has not yet been reported.

Arterial fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory
vascular disease, whose pathophysiology is still unknown. We performed deep
image-based vascular phenotyping of nonaffected arteries to look for systemic
vascular alterations in fibromuscular dysplasia. This single center
cross-sectional study included 50 patients with multifocal renal fibromuscular
dysplasia, 50 hypertensive patients, and 50 healthy controls, matched for age,
sex, and ethnicity; hypertensive patients were matched also for blood pressure.
Brachial artery endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent dilation were
studied by echotracking. Aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid-to-femoral
pulse wave velocity. We quantified the presence of supernumerary acoustic
interfaces within the common carotid wall by the triple signal (TS) score. We
plotted the Young incremental elastic modulus/stress curves for common carotid
artery, derived from echotracking and tonometry. Patients with fibromuscular
dysplasia had impaired endothelium-independent dilation (adjusted P=0.002),
smaller brachial artery diameter but comparable endothelium-dependent dilation
and aortic stiffness. The prevalence of TS score >6 was 56%, 40%, 24% in patients
with fibromuscular dysplasia, hypertensives, and controls, respectively (
P=0.005). Fibromuscular dysplasia remained significantly associated with TS in
the multiple regression model ( P=0.022). Impaired endothelium-dependent dilation
was present only in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, TS score >6 (
P=0.047). Incremental elastic modulus was higher for a given wall stress (80 kPa)
in the presence of a TS score >6, especially in fibromuscular dysplasia. In
conclusion, nonclinically affected large- and medium-sized arteries in patients
with multifocal renal fibromuscular dysplasia exhibit a cluster of diffuse
alterations in smooth muscle cell function, arterial geometry, wall
characteristics, and mechanical properties. Clinical Trial Registration URL:

We report the case of a 42-year-old patient referred for suspicion of
fibromuscular dysplasia in the context of a carotid artery dissection occurring
after a minor trauma. Initial complaints included left hemicrania, lateral
diplopia with left 6th cranial nerve palsy and pulsatile tinnitus. The work-up
disclosed a large left carotid-cavernous fistula, as well as more proximal
carotid lesions compatible with multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia. Personal
history included colonic and uterine perforation. Family history disclosed a
fatal hemorrhage due to rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm in the father and an
iliac dissection in the sister. Genetic screening revealed a mutation in exon 6
of the COL3A1 gene in the index patient and her sister, confirming the diagnosis 
of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). This case report shows that images
suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia may be found in patients with demonstrated 
vEDS. Furthermore, it reminds that in case of cervical artery dissection
occurring in a young patient, all efforts should be made to diagnose the
underlying condition. In particular, the existence of a family history of
arterial dissection, the occurrence of a carotid-cavernous fistula and
coexistence with other complications suggestive of a connective tissue disease
should prompt physicians to consider the diagnosis of vEDS.

BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly
recognized cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) afflicting predominantly
younger to middle-aged women. Observational studies have reported a high
prevalence of extracoronary vascular anomalies, especially fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD) and a low prevalence of coincidental cases of atherosclerosis.
PHACTR1/EDN1 is a genetic risk locus for several vascular diseases, including FMD
and coronary artery disease, with the putative causal noncoding variant at the
rs9349379 locus acting as a potential enhancer for the endothelin-1 (EDN1) gene.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the association between the rs9349379
genotype and SCAD.
METHODS: Results from case control studies from France, United Kingdom, United
States, and Australia were analyzed to test the association with SCAD risk,
including age at first event, pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD), and recurrent
SCAD.
RESULTS: The previously reported risk allele for FMD (rs9349379-A) was associated
with a higher risk of SCAD in all studies. In a meta-analysis of 1,055 SCAD
patients and 7,190 controls, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.67 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.86) per copy of rs9349379-A. In a subset of 491 SCAD
patients, the OR estimate was found to be higher for the association with SCAD in
patients without FMD (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.33) than in SCAD cases with FMD
(OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99). There was no effect of genotype on age at first
event, P-SCAD, or recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: The first genetic risk factor for SCAD was identified in the largest
study conducted to date for this condition. This genetic link may contribute to
the clinical overlap between SCAD and FMD.
