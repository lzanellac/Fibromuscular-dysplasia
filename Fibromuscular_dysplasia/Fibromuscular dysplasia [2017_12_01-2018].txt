We describe a case of concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and
atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) disease in a symptomatic patient.
Sixty-eight-year-old female presented for evaluation of a transient ischemic
attack. Imaging revealed severe proximal >80% ICA stenosis with severe FMD to mid
and distal ICA. Planned hybrid approach with left carotid endarterectomy (CEA)
and balloon angioplasty was aborted intraoperatively due to lack of back
bleeding. Open gradual rigid dilation was then performed with resumption of back 
bleeding. Completion angiogram revealed widely patent flow through CEA patch with
no residual defects. Patient awoke from operation neurologically intact. At
6-month follow-up, carotid duplex revealed severe recurrent ICA stenosis.
Endovascular intervention was performed with balloon dilation to the proximal and
mid-ICA with stenting of a moderate 60% ostial common carotid stenosis. She
recovered well from procedure with 3-month carotid duplex showing widely patent
common carotid stent and ICA with no areas of stenosis. Informed consent has been
obtained from the patient for publication of the case report and accompanying
images.

Background and Purpose- Carotid web (CW) is a rare form of focal fibromuscular
dysplasia defined as an abnormal shelf-like projection of intimal fibrous tissue 
into the carotid bulb. It is theorized that CW leads to ischemic stroke secondary
to blood flow stasis and subsequent embolization. The natural history and optimal
management of CW are unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a
systematic literature review (SLR) of CW. Methods- Our librarians performed a SLR
for CW and related terminology. Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, 
neuroimaging findings, stroke recurrence or stroke free-duration, and treatment
modality were extracted. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our
results. When specific patient-level metrics were not reported, the denominators 
for reporting percentage calculations were adjusted accordingly. Results- Our
literature search produced 1150 articles. Thirty-seven articles including 158
patients (median age 46 years [range 16-85], 68% women, 76% symptomatic) met
entry criteria and were included in our SLR. Of the symptomatic CW patients: 57% 
did not have stroke risk factors, 56% who received medical therapy had recurrent 
stroke (median 12 months, range 0-97), and 72% were ultimately treated with
carotid revascularization (50% carotid stenting, 50% carotid endarterectomy).
There were no periprocedural complications or recurrent strokes in carotid
revascularization patients. Conclusions- CW leads to ischemic stroke in younger
patients without conventional stroke risk factors. We found a high stroke
recurrence rate in medically managed symptomatic CW patients, whereas carotid
revascularization effectively prevented recurrent stroke. Our findings should be 
interpreted with caution because of risk of publication and reporting bias.

PURPOSE: Smoking was identified as a potential factor contributing to
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). To evaluate the prevalence of smoking and clinical
characteristics in FMD subjects.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 190 patients with confirmed FMD in at least one
vascular bed. The rate of smokers in FMD patients was compared to that in two
control groups selected from a nationwide survey.
RESULTS: The rate of smokers in FMD patients was 42.6%. There were no differences
in frequency of smokers between FMD patients and: a group of 994 matched control 
subjects from general population and a group of matched hypertensive subjects.
There were no differences in the characteristics of FMD (including rates of
multisite FMD and significant renal artery stenosis) and its complications
(including rates of dissections and aneurysms) between smokers and non-smokers.
Smokers as compared with non-smokers were characterized by higher left ventricle 
mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the rate of smokers between FMD patients
and subjects from the general population. Moreover, we did not find any
association between smoking and clinical characteristics of FMD patients nor its 
extent and vascular complications. Our results do not support the hypothesis that
smoking is involved in the pathophysiology of FMD.

Renal artery stenosis is a common cause of secondary hypertension and chronic
kidney disease. We present here a case of fibromuscular dysplasia that was
treated with surgical revascularization, resulting in recovery of kidney function
with eventual cessation of chronic dialysis. The case involves a 25-year-old
female with coincidentally discovered hypertension, who underwent further
investigations revealing a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis due to
fibromuscular dysplasia. She subsequently developed two episodes of malignant
hypertension, with flash pulmonary oedema and worsening renal failure that
resulted in dialysis dependence. After evidence was obtained that the right
kidney was still viable, a revascularization procedure was performed, improving
blood pressure control and restoring kidney function, thereby allowing dialysis
to be stopped. This case highlights the importance of evaluating patients with
renal artery stenosis for revascularization before committing them to a life of
chronic dialysis.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic disease that generally
affects medium-sized arteries. The distribution typically involves the renal,
extracranial carotid/vertebral, and iliac arteries. FMD in other vascular beds is
rare. We herein present the case of a 47-year-old female with rapid-onset
bilateral digital ischemia. Initial differential diagnosis included vasospastic
disorders and vasculitis. An upper extremity arteriogram was suggestive of ulnar 
and radial FMD. Percutaneous intervention was not successful, and the patient was
managed conservatively with symptomatic improvement. This case highlights the
important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in patients with less common 
etiologies of upper extremity ischemia.

Renal artery stenosis commonly manifests with hypertension refractory to medical 
treatment. We report a case of renal artery stenosis occurring in a 19-year-old
female patient who presented with extremely high blood pressure and bilateral
renal stenosis at the duplex ultrasound. Renal angiography confirmed the
bilateral and irregular stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia, associated to
extent collaterals suppling the poststenotic right renal artery. Therefore,
angioplasty with drug-eluting balloon was performed in order to obtain a good
vessel patency and to improve patency in the long term follow-up. After the
endovascular treatment the blood pressure improved markedly, maintaining this
result at 12 months follow-up at clinical examination and duplex ultrasound.

The pathophysiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is
heterogeneous, associated with systemic arteriopathies and inflammatory diseases,
and often compounded by environmental precipitants, genetics, or stressors.
However, the frequency of these associated conditions with SCAD on a population
level remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this analysis was to evaluate 
heterogeneous phenotypes of SCAD in the United States using data from the
Nationwide Inpatient Sample collected from January 1, 2004, to September 31,
2015. Among 66,360 patients diagnosed with SCAD, the mean age was 63.1 ± 13.2
years and 44.2% were women. A total of 3,415 (5.14%) had depression, 670 (1.0%)
had rheumatoid arthritis, 640 (0.96%) had anxiety, 545 (0.82%) had a migraine
disorder, 440 (0.66%) used steroids, 385 (0.58%) had malignant hypertension, 280 
(0.42%) had systemic lupus erythematosus, 250 (0.38%) had cocaine abuse, 215
(0.32%) had hypertensive heart or renal disease, 130 (0.19%) had coronary spasm, 
105 (0.16%) had fibromuscular dysplasia, 85 (0.13%) had Crohn's disease, 75
(0.11%) had celiac disease, 60 (0.09%) had adult autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney disease, 60 (0.09%) had hormone replacement therapy, 55 (0.08%) had
sarcoidosis, 55 (0.08%) had amphetamine abuse, 15 (0.02%) had granulomatosis
polyangiitis, 10 (0.02%) had α1-antitrypsin deficiency, 10 (0.02%) had Marfan
syndrome, 10 (0.02%) had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 10 (0.02%) had Kawasaki disease,
10 (0.02%) had polyarteritis nodosa, and 5 (0.01%) had multiparity. In
conclusion, most cases of SCAD had no apparent concomitant arteriopathy,
inflammatory disorder, or evident risk factor.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of acute
coronary syndrome especially in women. The most common underlying predisposing
cause of SCAD is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a non-inflammatory arteriopathy
that results in weakening of the affected arteries, and can cause dissection or
aneurysm. Coronary FMD (CFMD) was described as rare, and was shown to cause SCAD 
in histopathological case reports. Unfortunately, CFMD is challenging to diagnose
on coronary angiography, as the findings can be similar to other causes of
coronary artery disease. Therefore, we illustrate two case examples of CFMD on
coronary angiography, and highlight findings on optical coherence tomography to
aid diagnosis.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissections (SCADs) are increasingly recognized as an
important cause of acute coronary syndromes in predominantly women below 60 years
of age. SCAD patients comprise a heterogeneous group, in which it is estimated
that a quarter to one third have underlying fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).
Although the mutual relationship of SCAD and FMD is complex and only partly
understood, there seems to be some overlap in genetic background and interaction 
with endogenous sex-steroids. In this review we provide an update of our current 
knowledge on these intriguing emerging arteriopathies.

Unique imaging findings in fibromuscular dysplasia of renal arteries: A case
report.

RATIONALE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare vascular disorder that causes 
abnormal cell growth in arterial walls. The classic "string of beads" sign has
been reported in many cases, whereas the appearance of tubular stenosis and
distal tapering of renal arteries with multiple renal infarctions, as well as
left kidney atrophy occurring in one patient, has not been precisely described.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-year-old woman presented to us with a history of elevated 
blood pressure without any symptoms for the past 1 month. Routine laboratory
tests indicated a moderately impaired renal function, and ultrasound examination 
demonstrated a small-sized left kidney and seriously decreased blood flow of the 
left renal artery and its branches.
DIAGNOSIS: Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA)
demonstrated multiple ischemic infarctions in the bilateral kidneys, and FMD was 
suggested at that time. Thereafter, we performed selective reno-angiography,
which confirmed that the all left renal arteries had tubular stenosis and that
right renal arterial branches presented distal tapering.
INTERVENTION: Antihypertensive drugs were prescribed conservatively, including
nifedipine 60 mg/d and prazosin 4 mg/d, to lower the patient's blood pressure.
OUTCOMES: The patient had a well-controlled blood pressure and an improved renal 
function at her 6-month follow-up.
LESSONS: We should take the diagnosis of FMD into account if young women develop 
asymptomatic hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first case that
exhibited renal artery FMD manifesting as tubular stenosis and distal tapering,
especially followed by bilateral renal infarctions and significant atrophy of the
left kidney. In addition, CTA combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA)
may be more sensitive than other tests with respect to the detection of
intrarenal infarctions and arterial variants of FMD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Numerous studies have begun to unravel the genetic basis of
not only aortic disease but also other forms of commonly encountered vascular
diseases. The goal of this review is to provide clinicians a reference to help
identify and diagnose different types of vascular disease with a genetic
underpinning.
RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing studies have identified numerous genes involved in the
TGF-β signaling pathway that are also associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm
and dissection, and it is possible to test for pathogenic variants in these genes
in the clinical setting using commercially available genetic testing panels.
Additional studies have begun to identify genetic variants associated with an
increased risk of bicuspid aortic valve, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and
fibromuscular dysplasia. With increased availability of low-cost genetic testing,
clinicians are now able to not only definitively diagnose some vascular syndromes
but also provide information on the risk of disease in other family members, as
well as provide guidance in terms of family planning. As the cost of genetic
testing continues to drop with the benefit of increasing insurance coverage,
genetic data will increasingly become part of clinical care for many patients
with vascular disease.

Background: A carotid web (CaW) is a shelf-like lesion in the posterior aspect of
the internal carotid bulb and represents an intimal variant of fibromuscular
dysplasia. CaW has been associated with recurrent strokes and conventionally
treated with surgical excision. We report a multicenter experience of stenting in
patients with symptomatic CaWs.
Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted to 5 comprehensive
stroke centers who were identified to have a symptomatic CaW and treated with
carotid stenting. A symptomatic CaW was defined by the presence of a
shelf-like/linear, smooth filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid
bulb diagnosed by neck CT angiography (CTA) and confirmed with conventional
angiography in patients with negative stroke workup.
Results: Twenty-four patients with stented symptomatic CaW were identified
(stroke in 83% and transient ischemic attack in 17%). Their median age was 47
years (IQR 41-61), 14 (58%) were female, and were 17 (71%) black. The degree of
stenosis by NASCET was 0% (range 0-11). All patients were placed on dual
antiplatelets and stented at a median of 9 days (IQR 4-35) after the last event. 
Closed-cell stents were used in 18 (75%) of the cases. No periprocedural events
occurred with the exception of 2 cases of asymptomatic hypotension/bradycardia.
Clinical follow-up after stent placement occurred for a median of 12 months (IQR 
3-19) with no new cerebrovascular events noted. Functional independence at 90
days was achieved in 22 (91%) patients. Follow-up vascular imaging (ultrasound n 
= 18/CTA n = 5) was performed at a median of 10 months (IQR 3-18) and revealed no
stenosis.
Conclusions: Stenting for symptomatic CaW appears to be a safe and effective
alternative to surgical resection. Further studies are warranted.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) mainly develops in medium-sized arteries, including
renal, extracranial, and extremity arteries, but it rarely causes abdominal
aortic aneurysm (AAA). A 69-year-old woman with AAA diagnosed on ultrasonography 
by a home doctor visited our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography
revealed a saccular aneurysm of terminal abdominal aorta. We performed abdominal 
aortic replacement and resected the section with aneurysm. Pathological
examination of the wall tissue of the resected aneurysm revealed findings that
are consistent with FMD. We report this case of AAA caused by aortic FMD because 
of its rarity.

Carotid webs are an uncommon cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes. They are
considered a form of fibromuscular dysplasia, possibly developmental in origin,
with non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic features and a characteristic
appearance on CT angiography. They have been described as a thin intraluminal
filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb in oblique sagittal
reformats and a septum on axial CT angiography. Here we summarize two cases of
ischaemic strokes secondary to carotid webs with characteristic images. Detection
and awareness of carotid webs and their imaging features among radiologists and
physicians are important as it is associated with a high risk of recurrent
cerebrovascular events.

OBJECTIVE: To study functional outcome, mortality, and dialysis free survival in 
patients undergoing open primary surgical repair of renal artery stenosis (RAS)
or aneurysm (RAA).
METHODS: This was a retrospective single centre study of patients undergoing open
surgical renal artery reconstruction from 1993 to 2007. Blood pressure, renal
function, dialysis dependence, vessel patency, and mortality were registered.
Survival was investigated by cross matching with the population registry,
yielding up to 20 years of follow up.
RESULTS: Of the 40 patients operated on, 25 (63%) were women. RAS was the
indication for reconstruction in 31 patients; 23 had atherosclerotic aetiology
(ARAS), and eight had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Nine patients had RAA.
Patients with ARAS were older (p = .008), had more extensive peripheral arterial 
disease (p = .004), and inferior renal function (p = .003) compared with patients
with FMD or RAA. In FMD and RAA, the right renal artery was affected in 13/17
(76%) cases, whereas in ARAS the disease was evenly distributed. In patients with
ARAS, 15/25 (60%) stenotic renal arteries (two bilateral procedures) were managed
by aorto-renal bypass, and 2/25 (8%) through ilio-renal bypass. In 8/25 (32%)
endarterectomy was performed. In FMD, all but one patient underwent aorto-renal
bypass. Early mortality was 2.5% (one patient with ARAS). One patient with ARAS
required dialysis post-operatively. Systolic blood pressure was significantly
reduced in patients with ARAS, from 180 mmHg (median) pre-operatively to
155 mmHg at one month (p = .003) and 160 mmHg at one year (p = .03). Need for
medication decreased from three or more drugs to two drugs at one month
(p = .01). In FMD, there was a similar tendency. Three patients underwent
re-intervention for restenosis: two endovascularly and one by open surgery. The
overall 5 year survival was 88%. Median follow up was 10.6 years.
CONCLUSION: Open surgical renal arterial reconstruction was performed with low
mortality, fairly low morbidity, and excellent durability. Open surgery should
still be considered a therapeutic option in complex renal artery disease.

BACKGROUND: The increasing frequency of elderly patients with severe tortuous
anatomy, especially when combined with fibromuscular dysplasia, can make
intracranial canalization severely difficult or impossible. Computed tomography
angiography was used to determine the feasibility of accessing the internal
carotid artery (ICA) via a percutaneous translacerum approach.
METHODS: Twenty consecutive stroke activations with CT angiography were
reconstructed in three-dimensional models to take measurements to assess if
currently available technologies could safely provide access. We assessed the
diameter of the foramen lacerum and ICA. Entry points and angulations were
measured based on trajectory. Our trajectory was based on anatomic observations
that provided a safe corridor from the angle of the jaw to the foramen lacerum.
RESULTS: Based on the 40 carotid arteries from 20 patients, 77.5% had a large
enough foramen lacerum to provide access to the ICA. Although there were no
traversals of the pharynx, we noted a 20% traversal of the eustachian tube and 5%
traversal of a small maxillary artery branch. There was no large-vessel traversal
by the trajectory. All patients with bilateral stenotic foramen lacerum were
African-American women; 44% of African-American women had bilateral stenotic
foramen lacerum. The diameter of the ICA and foramen lacerum would not be
prohibitive of sheath placement in patients without stenosis with adequate
canalized length of sheath necessary for stability.
CONCLUSIONS: Access of the ICA via the foramen lacerum can be safely performed
with currently available technologies.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) usually appears as an acute
coronary syndrome with good prognosis. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman
with progressive SCAD secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia with catastrophic
course. The patient required several mechanical circulatory support systems
including a left ventricular assist device (CentriMag®, Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA,
USA) as bridge to recovery. <Learning objective: The beneficial use of mechanical
circulatory support devices as a bridge to recovery or heart transplant in the
setting of refractory cardiogenic shock in spontaneous coronary artery
dissection.>.

True renal artery aneurysms are rare. Ruptured aneurysms are even rarer but can
have devastating consequences. Renal artery aneurysms most commonly occur in
patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, or fibromuscular dysplasia.
Treatment options can range from embolization to nephrectomy. We describe an
interesting case of spontaneous accessory renal artery aneurysm rupture in a
44-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who otherwise had no
medical problems. She was successfully treated with selective coil embolization, 
recovered without complications, and maintained preoperative renal function.

A 50-year-old man had a sudden severe abdominal pain. An abdominal enhanced
computed tomographic scan revealed irregular stenosis of the celiac artery,
dissection of the hepatic artery and of the left common iliac artery, and mid
stenosis of the right renal artery with extended renal parenchymal hypodensity.
After careful evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with fibromuscular dysplasia.
Systematic head and neck CT angiography revealed right vertebral arterial
stenosis and saccular aneurysm of the left vertebral artery. We have chosen
conservative medical treatment for the multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia.

Renal arteriovenous fistulas are pathologic communications between the renal
arteries and veins without interconnecting capillaries. Reports on the
combination of fibromuscular dysplasia, aneurysms, and renal arteriovenous
fistula are extremely rare in the literature. In the case of renal arteriovenous 
aneurysm rupture, urgent nephrectomy was the only life-saving procedure reported.
The ex vivo approach seems to be an appropriate alternative to nephrectomy. This 
article presents a case of successful treatment of bilateral fibromuscular
dysplasia with aneurysm and arteriovenous fistulas complicated by renal artery
aneurysm rupture.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) represents an increasingly
recognized cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), especially in young females.
Novel diagnostic insights obtained from intracoronary imaging and the frequent
association with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), have recently enriched our
understanding of this unique clinical entity. Recently, two scientific statements
from both sides of the Atlantic, summarizing the available information on SCAD,
have been simultaneously published. These should help to guide the clinical
management of these challenging patients. Major collaborative research efforts
are required to move from expert-based recommendations to evidence-based
[corrected] medicine.

The vascular diseases including aneurysm, occlusion, and thromboses in the
mesenteric lesions could cause severe symptoms and appropriate diagnosis and
treatment are essential for managing patients. With the development and
improvement of imaging modalities, diagnostic frequency of these vascular
diseases in abdominal lesions is increasing even with the small changes in the
vasculatures. Among various vascular diseases, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and 
segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) are noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic
arterial diseases which need to be diagnosed urgently because these diseases
could affect various organs and be lethal if the appropriate management is not
provided. However, because FMD and SAM are rare, the cause, prevalence, clinical 
characteristics including the symptoms, findings in the imaging studies,
pathological findings, management, and prognoses have not been systematically
summarized. Therefore, there have been neither standard diagnostic criteria nor
therapeutic methodologies established, to date. To systematically summarize the
information and to compare these disease entities, we have summarized the
characteristics of FMD and SAM in the gastroenterological regions by reviewing
the cases reported thus far. The information summarized will be helpful for
physicians treating these patients in an emergency care unit and for the
differential diagnosis of other diseases showing severe abdominal pain.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, segmental, non-atherosclerotic
and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to
stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries, mostly involving renal and cervical 
arteries. As a result of better and more systematic screening, it appears that
involvement of the splanchnic vascular bed is more frequent than originally
assumed. We review epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture as well as
diagnosis and treatment of visceral artery (VA) FMD. The clinical picture is very
diverse, and diagnosis is based on CT-, MR- or conventional catheter-based
angiography. Involvement of VAs generally occurs among patients with multi-vessel
FMD. Therefore, screening for VA FMD is advised especially in renal artery (RA)
FMD and in case of aneurysms and/or dissections. Treatment depends on the
clinical picture. However, the level of evidence is low, and much of the common
practice is extrapolated from visceral atherosclerotic disease.

We describe successful endovascular treatment of a patient with fibromuscular
dysplasia of the celiac axis leading to development of a common hepatic artery
pseudoaneurysm with contained rupture. An 81-year-old woman was transferred to
our quaternary care center with concern for a hepatic artery rupture. Further
imaging demonstrated a common hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm with surrounding
hematoma as well as multifocal areas of narrowing and dilatation in the celiac
trunk consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia. A similar pattern was subsequently
identified in the bilateral renal and carotid arteries. The patient underwent
successful endovascular exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm with a balloon-expandable
covered stent and was discharged home without incident. Fibromuscular dysplasia
is a nonatherosclerotic arteriopathy that can lead to stenosis, occlusion,
dissection, and aneurysm formation. While it primarily affects the carotid and
renal arteries, there are rare case reports involving the mesenteric vasculature.
Endovascular therapy appears to be a feasible treatment option for the
complicated sequelae of this condition in the rare case of mesenteric arterial
involvement.

association of LOPD and arteriopathy should always be considered in clinical
practice.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a condition caused by an abnormal development or
growth of cells in the arterial walls in the body. We present a case of a
49-year-old male who came in with a sudden onset of severe left-sided abdominal
pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was suggestive of a left renal
infarct. He underwent renal angiography that showed FMD and a clot located in the
anterior branch of the left renal artery. The patient was then treated with
apixaban for the clot and amlodipine for the associated hypertension. Our case
will highlight the importance of recognizing renal infarction as an initial
presentation of FMD.

Natural History of Cervical Artery Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Associated
Neurovascular Events.

Kadian-Dodov D, Goldfinger JZ, Gustavson S, Olin JW.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic
arteriopathy most often affecting the carotid and renal arteries. In the United
States Registry for FMD, 41.7% of patients experienced an aneurysm and/or
dissection by the time of entry into the Registry. We sought to determine the
occurrence of neurovascular events after FMD diagnosis and any changes on
cervical artery imaging that may be attributable to FMD.
METHODS: Patients followed at the Mount Sinai Medical Center (US Registry for FMD
enrollment center) with confirmed FMD and > 1 cervical artery imaging study (at
least ± 6 months from the baseline carotid duplex ultrasound [CDU]) between the
years 2003 and 2015 were included. Medical records and cervical artery imaging
([CDU], magnetic resonance angiogram [MRA], and computed tomography angiogram
[CTA]) were reviewed. New arterial dissection, aneurysm, transient ischemic
attack, stroke, or new FMD findings were recorded.
RESULTS: Among 146 FMD patients with complete information, 52 (35.6%) had an
aneurysm and 52 (35.6%) had a dissection. Mean clinical follow-up was 35.3 ± 25.3
months (range 5-153 months); patients underwent 4 ± 2.7 CDU (range 1-17); 86.3%
had ≥1 neck MRA or CTA. After FMD diagnosis, 3 patients (2%) experienced a new
carotid artery dissection; 1 patient experienced a stroke due to concomitant
atherosclerosis. No new aneurysms occurred. In patients with cervical artery FMD,
imaging findings remained stable throughout follow-up. No patient developed new
cervical artery FMD findings on follow-up imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: No new cervical artery FMD or aneurysm was observed on subsequent
imaging. New carotid dissection was uncommon over a mean follow-up period of 35.3
± 25.3 months and was the only non-atherosclerotic vascular event observed after 
FMD diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare and controversial disease
that is seldom associated with genes. Here, we report the discovery of 2 missense
mutations in COL4A5 and COL4A6 that may be risk factors for causing
cerebrovascular FMD. We performed high-throughput sequencing on a patient with
FMD and her probable healthy daughter, then annotated the frequency of a variant 
in a control or general population and assessed its deleterious effects according
to published guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified missense mutations in COL4A5 (exon43:c.C3940 >
T:p.P1314S) and COL4A6 (exon36:c.C3538 > T:p.P1180S) from the proband and her
daughter. Sanger sequencing revealed that these probable causal variants were
passed to her from her mother. The two missense mutations may have complex
functional effects on the integrity of the cerebral vessel walls, including
modulating collagens and promoting angiogenesis expression, may be responsible
for cerebrovascular FMD.

The time trends regarding the etiology of renal artery stenosis (RAS) are
changing, but few investigations have focused on these issues. This study aimed
to analyze the time trends regarding the etiology of RAS in a large patient
sample from the China Center for Cardiovascular Disease. Consecutive inpatients
with RAS from January 1999 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study. The
etiologic diagnosis of RAS was based on established criteria. We retrospectively 
analyzed the time trends regarding the etiology of RAS during an 18-year period. 
A total of 2905 patients with RAS were enrolled. There were 2393 (82.4%) patients
with atherosclerosis (AS), 345 (11.9%) with Takayasu arteritis (TA), 126 (4.3%)
with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and 41 (1.4%) with other causes. Among all
patients (n = 2905), patients aged ≤ 40 years (n = 450), patients aged >40 years 
(n = 2455), female patients (n = 1097), male patients (n = 1808), female patients
aged >40 years (n = 808), and male patients aged >40 years (n = 1647), there were
a gradual increase in the proportion of atherosclerotic RAS (P < 0.05), a gradual
decrease in the proportion of RAS caused by TA (P < 0.05), and almost no change
in the proportion of RAS caused by FMD during the 18-year period (P > 0.05). The 
data show that the primary causes of RAS are AS, TA, and FMD. The proportion of
RAS caused by AS and TA gradually increased and decreased, respectively, over
time, and the proportion of RAS caused by FMD showed no significant change.

Introduction: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) 
aneurysms are rare vascular conditions. An unusual combination of both diseases
is reported.
Case report: A 54 year old woman presented with symptomatic SMA aneurysm. A
diagnosis of FMD was made on the basis of computed tomography angiography (CTA). 
The patient had undergone gender reassignment surgery 10 years previously and
continued to use both topical and oral hormonal therapy. The patient received
open anatomical bypass through a retroperitoneal approach using great saphenous
vein.
Conclusion: Superior mesenteric artery aneurysms are rare and a diagnosis of FMD 
should be considered as part of the diagnosis process. Anatomical bypass should
be considered carefully in relation to a patient's fitness as well as anatomical 
suitability.

Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms are rare. The most common location is the
common carotid artery near the bifurcation. The mid to distal internal carotid
artery is the second most common location. We are reporting the case of a
64-year-old woman who was admitted to our department for management of an
asymptomatic left internal carotid artery aneurysm. Physical examination revealed
a pulsatile mass, and imaging confirmed the aneurysm diagnosis. Computed
tomography angiography detailed a 28mm×3cm×6cm aneurysm of the left cervical
internal carotid artery with tortuous outflow the aneurysm sac. Open repair was
undertaken. Exposure with incision anterior to the sternocleidomastoid was
performed although extended more superiorly than usual because of the distal
aneurysm location. After carotid clamping, the aneurysm was resected and an
end-to-end anastomosis with prosthesis was performed. After closure, the patient 
was extubated demonstrating baseline neurologic function. Histologic examination 
of the arterial wall confirmed the diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a heterogeneous group of systemic, noninflammatory,
and nonatherosclerotic diseases of the vascular wall. It is the second-most
common abnormality of the renal artery. Although hypertension is the most common 
presenting symptom, other symptoms, such as pulsatile tinnitus, stroke, chest
pain, or abdominal discomfort, may result from other affected vascular beds.
Revascularization of the renal artery appears to be effective at lowering blood
pressure in many patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia. For a long
time, the intrarenal pathophysiological changes and mechanisms leading to
hypertension had hardly been studied in patients with renal artery fibromuscular 
dysplasia. Recent data, however, has provided more insight into the effects of
renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia on the intrarenal microvasculature and the
intra-renal renin-angiotensin system in these patients. Moreover, these data have
changed our view of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension in 
patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia. In this review, we will
discuss recent clinical and scientific developments regarding renal artery
fibromuscular dysplasia with an emphasis on its effects on the kidney.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A 42-year-old woman presented with anterior ST elevation
myocardial infarction. Urgent coronary angiography revealed tapering then
occlusion of the distal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery with no
flow in the distal LAD (figure 1A). Balloon angioplasty with a 2.0×8 mm balloon
re-established flow into the distal LAD. An angiogram of the right external iliac
artery was also performed (figure 1B).heartjnl;104/19/1607/F1F1F1Figure 1Invasive
angiography of the left coronary system (A) and the right external iliac artery
(B). The coronary angiogram (A) shows tapering and then occlusion (arrow) of the 
distal left anterior descending coronary artery.
QUESTION: Which of the following explains the abnormal appearance of the external
iliac artery (figure 1B)?Atherosclerosis.Concertina effect.Fibromuscular
dysplasia.Perforation.Multiple aneurysms.

We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who developed an acute type B aortic
dissection caused by an entry tear from an aneurysmal left common iliac artery
that extended retrograde to the proximal descending thoracic aorta. She
experienced refractory chest pain despite optimal medical management, thereby
indicating repair. Endovascular aortic repair was subsequently performed.
Intraoperatively, fibromuscular dysplasia was diagnosed by the characteristic
appearance of her renal arteries. The patient tolerated the procedure and had
resolution of her chest pain. In summary, we present a highly unusual case of
type B aortic dissection resulting from a retrograde common iliac artery tear in 
a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia.

Importance: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic arterial
disease that predominately affects women and is most commonly diagnosed in middle
age. The natural history of FMD among patients diagnosed at an older age is not
well understood.
Objective: To examine the differences in clinical presentation, arterial bed
involvement, vascular events, and need for vascular procedures between younger
and older patients with FMD.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of baseline data for patients
enrolled in the US Registry for FMD as of December 15, 2016, at referral centers 
participating in the US Registry for FMD. Patients 18 years and older at the time
of enrollment and those with only confirmed multifocal (string of beads type) FMD
were included. Patients were categorized according to age at the time of
diagnosis (≥65 years vs <65 years).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of specific symptoms, vascular events, and
prior vascular procedures at the time of enrollment in the registry.
Results: A total of 1016 patients were included in the analysis, of whom, 170
(16.7%) were 65 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Older patients with FMD 
were more likely to be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (4.2% vs 1.4%;
P = .02). Headache and pulsatile tinnitus, both common manifestations of FMD,
were less common in older patients (40.5% vs 69.1%; P < .001 and 30% vs 44.6%;
P < .001, respectively). Extracranial carotid arteries were more commonly
involved in patients 65 years or older at time of diagnosis (87% vs 79.4%;
P = .03). There was no difference in prevalence of renal artery involvement,
number of arterial beds involved, or diagnosis of any aneurysm. Patients 65 years
or older were less likely to have had a major vascular event (37.1% vs 46.1%;
P = .03) and fewer had undergone a therapeutic vascular procedure (18.5% vs
33.1%; P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: In the US Registry for FMD, patients 65 years or older
at the time of diagnosis of multifocal FMD were more likely to be asymptomatic,
had lower prevalence of major vascular events, and had undergone fewer
therapeutic vascular procedures than younger patients. Patients with multifocal
FMD diagnosed at an older age may have a more benign phenotype and fewer
symptoms.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a variant of acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) that is poorly understood. SCAD has been linked to fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD), connective tissue disease (CTD), pregnancy and hormonal
imbalance, systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g. IBD, vasculitis), and coronary 
artery vasospasm rather than traditional cardiac risk factors. Symptomology
generally accompanying SCAD is indistinguishable from ACS making the timely
recognition and diagnosis vital for prompt treatment. Management of SCAD is not
well defined given the absence of guidelines; conservative therapy with or
without invasive intervention is assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this
article, we report the case of a 62-year-old male, who presented with chest pain 
and dyspnea on exertion and was found to have an elevated troponin-I level and
corresponding electrocardiogram (EKG) findings, subsequently diagnosed with a
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography revealed a 
distal right coronary artery (RCA) dissection, which was confirmed later with
intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The patient then underwent percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI) followed by stenting of the distal RCA and was discharged on
optimal medical therapy. Herein, we report a case of SCAD in an otherwise healthy
male with chest pain at rest and with mild exertion without conventional cardiac 
risk factors.

OBJECTIVE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) can be classified in a multifocal and a 
unifocal subtype. As unifocal FMD generally leads to more severe hypertension at 
younger age, we hypothesized that renal hemodynamics are more disturbed in
unifocal renal artery FMD as compared with multifocal FMD, leading to increased
renin secretion.
METHODS: We measured renal blood flow (Xenon washout method), renin secretion,
and glomerular filtration rate per kidney in 101 patients with FMD (26 unifocal
and 75 multifocal), all off medication and prior to balloon angioplasty.
RESULTS: We found that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were
substantially lower in kidneys with unifocal FMD as compared with multifocal FMD.
In the affected kidney from patients with unilateral FMD for example, mean renal 
blood flow was 173 ± 77 in unifocal vs. 244 ± 79 ml/100 g kidney/min in
multifocal FMD (P = 0.013). Moreover, lateralization in renin secretion was only 
observed in a subset of patients with unifocal FMD, but not in any of the
patients with multifocal FMD.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the impact of unifocal FMD lesions on the
kidney is more severe, resulting in a classical pattern of renovascular
hypertension. In multifocal FMD, however, renal blood flow is more preserved,
local renin secretion is not increased, and the association between renin levels 
and blood pressure is inverse. These differences may explain the often more
severe clinical presentation and higher success rate of revascularization in
unifocal FMD, but also suggest that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to 
hypertension may differ between these two disease entities.

Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is &ldquo;an idiopathic, segmental,
non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial
walls, leading to stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries&rdquo; (Persu, et
al; 2014). FMD can lead to hypertension, arterial dissections, subarachnoid
haemorrhage, stroke or mesenteric ischemia. The pathophysiology of the disease
remains elusive. While familial cases are rare (<5%) in contemporary FMD
registries, there is evidence in favour of the existence of multiple genetic
factors involved in this vascular disease. Recent collaborative efforts allowed
the identification of a first genetic locus associated with FMD. This intronic
variant located in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) may
influence the transcription activity of the endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) located
nearby on chromosome 6. Interestingly, the PHACTR1 locus has also been involved
in vascular hypertrophy in normal subjects, carotid dissection, migraine and
coronary artery disease. National and international registries of FMD patients,
with deep and harmonised phenotypic and genetic characterisation, are expected to
be instrumental to improve our understanding of the genetic basis and
pathophysiology of this intriguing vascular disease.

BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory vascular disease 
that in children unlike in adults shows no sex predilection. FMD is often
underdiagnosed, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Delayed diagnosis may lead to
refractory hypertension and decreases the chance of successful treatment. Doppler
ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography
angiography (CTA), and catheter-based angiography (angiography) are currently
used to help make a clinicoradiological diagnosis of FMD. The main aim of the
study was to compare the efficacy of imaging modalities which can allow for
earlier and improved detection. Furthermore, an anatomical mapping of the
location of lesions can help determine the best treatment modalities.
METHODS: All patients with non-syndromic non-inflammatory renovascular
hypertension were recruited from the Nephrology Department at the Children's
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and enrolled in the U.S. FMD Registry maintained 
at the University of Michigan. Clinical presentation and imaging findings on US, 
CT, and MRI of children diagnosed with FMD were evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 7 ± 4.9 years (4 months-17 years). Family
history of hypertension (HTN) (52%), FMD (8.7%), Caucasian (60%), headache (48%),
and HTN (80%) were the most prevalent symptom and sign at presentation. Bruits
were 100% specific for renal artery stenosis (RAS) diagnosis but were heard in
the minority of patients (3 patients, 12%). FMD was mainly unifocal within a
single site (68%) or multiple sites (28%) and involved the main or first order
renal branch in about 68% of children. Isolated distal lesions beyond the second 
order branches were found in about 25% of children. US imaging was significantly 
less sensitive than angiography (28%, p = 0.003). MRA had a better sensitivity
(62.5%, p = 0.3) than US. Overall, CTA had the best sensitivity (84.2%, p = 0.4) 
compared to angiography; however, only angiography showed distal vessel disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of the study include the sample size and biases-only
patients diagnosed with FMD were included in this study and most patients were
referred to a pediatric nephrologist for unexplained hypertension. Angiography
should be performed as part of the initial work-up of any child suspected of
having renovascular FMD, regardless of the findings seen on US, MRA, or CTA.

The authors present a clinical-morphological observation of the 47-year old man
with a severe fatal ischemic stroke due to middle cerebral artery thrombosis
which developed at the site of intimal rupture. The cause of intimal rupture was 
the arterial wall dysplastic changes. There were no signs of atherosclerosis and 
hypercoagulation. As the intima rupture did not lead to blood input into arterial
wall, but was accompanied by superimposed thrombosis, we suggested to denote such
cases as incomplete dissection.

The case of a 16-year-old male patient with left renal artery stenosis due to
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and an atrophic kidney due to a right multicystic
dysplastic kidney (MCDK) who presented with refractory hypertension is reported. 
On continuous Doppler imaging, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the stenotic
site of the left renal artery was 404 cm/s. The FMD formed a "string-of-beads"
appearance on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and renal artery
angiography. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with a balloon
catheter was performed, after which the left renal artery returned to near
normal, and his blood pressure decreased to within the normal range. In this
case, the main cause of refractory hypertension was considered to have been renal
artery stenosis due to left FMD.

A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and
disturbed consciousness. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed right vertebral
artery dissection and abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed dissection of
the superior mesenteric artery. The patient was diagnosed as having fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD) based on conventional angiography. Although multiple vascular bed
involvement is observed in approximately 40% of FMD patients, reports of
sequential symptomatic dissections in various vascular beds are rare. Patients
with FMD and dissection require close observation, and hemodynamic stabilization 
may prevent not only the further development of dissection, but also subsequent
dissection of other arteries.

A 33-year-old man was admitted to our hospital to undergo an evaluation to
determine the cause of secondary hypertension. Computerized tomography
angiography (CTA) showed bilateral multiple renal arteries with significant
stenosis of the right extra-renal artery due to fibromuscular dysplasia and
segmental impairment of renal perfusion. Although the plasma aldosterone
concentration and plasma renin activity were within the normal ranges,
percutaneous balloon dilatation of the stenotic lesion resolved his hypertension,
leading to a diagnosis of renovascular hypertension caused by segmental renal
ischemia due to extra-renal artery stenosis. CTA should be considered during the 
examination of patients with early-age hypertension, even if the plasma renin
activity is not sufficiently elevated.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an increasingly recognized
nonatherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome. Reports regarding the
prognosis and natural history of this disease are limited. In addition to the
diagnostic difficulty, this condition poses a significant therapeutic challenge
due to the lack of specific management guidelines. We present here a case series 
of 9 patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Additionally, this
article reviews the incidence, clinical characteristics, risk factors, diagnostic
modalities, therapeutic approaches, and patterns of recurrence in patients with
spontaneous coronary artery dissection.

BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which usually affects the renal
artery, also affects the carotid, vertebral, and intracranial arteries. Previous 
studies have shown a high prevalence of concomitant renal artery and
cervicocranial lesions in FMD patients. However, the analyzed subjects were
mostly Caucasians in Western countries.
METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis to examine the prevalence of
cervicocranial vascular lesions in Japanese FMD patients with renal artery
involvement at a single institution. The presence of cervicocranial lesions was
evaluated by Doppler echography and magnetic resonance angiography. We compared
this prevalence with that reported in the literature.
RESULT: Thirty-one Japanese FMD patients with renal artery lesions were studied. 
The mean age was 30 ± 12 years, 71% were women, and 16% were smokers; all
patients were Asians and had hypertension. Multifocal, tubular, and unifocal
types of renal lesions were found in 52, 35, and 13% of patients, respectively.
Bilateral renal lesions were found in 13% of patients. None of the patients had a
cervical vascular lesion associated with FMD. Only two patients (8%) had a lesion
in the intracranial artery, of which one was a known case of moyamoya disease.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cervical artery involvement and
intracranial artery involvement are not common in renal FMD patients in Japan,
which is in contrast to the data reported for Caucasian patients in Western
countries. Ethnic differences could influence the occurrence of cervicocranial
lesions. A study with a larger sample size should be performed to validate these 
findings.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies describing genetics evaluation in spontaneous
coronary artery dissection (SCAD) have been retrospective in nature or presented 
as single case reports. As part of a dedicated clinical program, we evaluated
patients in cardiovascular genetics clinic to determine the role of genetically
triggered vascular disease and genetic testing in SCAD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient data were entered prospectively into the
Massachusetts General Hospital SCAD registry database from July 2013 to September
2017. Clinically indicated genetic testing was conducted based on patient
imaging, family history, physical examination, and patient preference. Of the 107
patients enrolled in the registry, 73 underwent cardiovascular genetics
evaluation at our center (average age, 45.3±9.4 years; 85.3% female), and genetic
testing was performed for 44 patients. A family history of aneurysm or dissection
was not a prevalent feature in the study population, and only 1 patient had a
family history of SCAD. Six patients (8.2%) had identifiable genetically
triggered vascular disease: 3 with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (COL3A1), 1
with Nail-patella syndrome (LMX1B), 1 with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney
disease (PKD1), and 1 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (SMAD3). None of these 6 had
radiographic evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 8.2% of the SCAD patients evaluated had a
molecularly identifiable disorder associated with vascular disease. The most
common diagnosis was vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Patients with positive gene
testing were significantly younger at the time of their first SCAD event. A low
threshold for genetic testing should be considered in patients with SCAD.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause
of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in young women who otherwise do not have
traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease. Though previously
considered to be a rare occurrence and primarily associated with pregnancy,
contemporary series have demonstrated that SCAD may account for 35% of ACS in
women under the age of 50 years, and peripartum SCAD accounts for the minority of
cases. Importantly, an association between SCAD and arterial abnormalities in
non-coronary arterial distributions has been described. The most common of these 
arterial abnormalities is fibromuscular dysplasia. This manuscript will briefly
review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of SCAD and provide an overview
of how SCAD may be a cardiac manifestation of an underlying vascular disease in
the majority of patients.

Background: The prevalence of cerebral aneurysms is increased in fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD). The presence of FMD may serve as discouragement to elective
endovascular aneurysm treatment. Outcomes of endovascular intervention for
aneurysms through vessels affected by FMD have not been reported.
Methods: A prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing intracranial 
embolization was reviewed for patients with FMD who underwent endovascular
aneurysm treatment.
Results: A total of 1,025 patients were screened and 31 (3.0%) had
cerebrovascular FMD. These patients underwent a total of 43 embolization
procedures; 27 of these procedures were performed through an affected vessel. All
but 1 patient were female and the average age was 62 years.
"String-of-pearls"-type FMD was the most common subtype (90%). The internal
carotid arteries were more commonly affected (65%) than the vertebral arteries
(48%). All patients underwent treatment of cerebral aneurysms, most of which
(87%) were incidentally discovered; 6 patients (19%) also had incidental vessel
dissection. The average aneurysm size was 7.1 mm. The morphology was saccular in 
93% of the cases, and 86% were in the anterior circulation. The most commonly
performed treatment was flow diversion (67%), in the majority of cases by
pipeline embolization. Other procedures performed were coiling (19%),
stent-coiling (12%), and intrasaccular flow disruption (2%). All but 1 procedure 
(98%) were successful. There were no major complications; 1 patient experienced a
transient ischemic attack. Follow-up angiography was performed in 88% of the
cases, without evidence for disease progression after treatment. The average time
to last angiographic follow-up was 17 months (±13).
Conclusions: Elective embolization of intracranial aneurysms can be performed
safely through vessels affected by FMD.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory arteriopathy of unknown etiology
that affects medium-sized arteries. Although patients affected with it are often 
asymptomatic, some might have recurrent catastrophic events that depend mainly on
the arterial bed involved. The most worrisome vascular complications of the
disease are aneurysmal rupture and arterial dissection. Herein, we report a case 
of a 49-year-old woman who presented with sudden-onset abdominal pain without any
inciting factors. She was found to have active blood extravasation from a
capsular branch of the renal artery that happened spontaneously. Angiography
revealed fibromuscular dysplasia in the renal arteries without any obvious
aneurysms. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature describing 
such an event. In this article, we also review the possible underlying pathology 
behind such an event.

Carotid web is a radiological description of a shelf-like intraluminal filling
defect in the carotid bulb. It is histologically defined as atypical
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), with abnormal fibrosis and smooth muscle cell
hyperplasia in the tunica intima. The spur-like intraluminal protrusion can serve
as a nidus for thrombus formation, which could cause systemic embolism and
ischemic strokes. We report a case of a 20-year-old female patient presenting
with acute ischemic stroke in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA)
territory. We also discuss the incidence, the prevalence, the pathophysiology,
the treatment, and the recurrence of carotid web based on the currently available
literature.

Background: The results of recent trials have brought some confusion to the
treatment strategy for renal artery stenosis (RAS). To evaluate the applicability
of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for RAS, we extracted the
factors that may affect the effectiveness of PTRA from cases experienced at a
hypertension center.
Methods and Results: We retrospectively assessed the blood pressure (BP) lowering
effects and renoprotective effects in 50 consecutive patients that had
hemodynamically significant RAS and had undergone PTRA and stenting during
2001-2005. Subjects were diagnosed with atherosclerotic RAS (42), fibromuscular
dysplasia (6), or Takayasu disease (2). After PTRA, BP significantly lowered from
152.3/80.3 mmHg to 132.6/73.2 mmHg (p < 0.05), but the estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) did not change significantly. There were no factors
associated with the BP lowering effects of PTRA. The baseline resistive index
(RI) was negatively correlated with the change in eGFR (p < 0.05). After
correction for age, sex, BMI, and the dose of contrast medium, the association of
RI with change in eGFR remained significant.
Conclusion: In cases with hemodynamically significant RAS, PTRA lowered BP but
was not effective in improving renal function. Higher baseline RI may be a factor
for predicting poor clinical course of renal function after PTRA.

Fibromuscular dyplasia (FMD) is an under-recognized non-atherosclerotic,
non-inflammatory arteriopathy that occurs most commonly in middle-aged women, but
may affect individuals of all age groups. FMD may result in stenosis, aneurysm,
dissection, occlusion, or arterial tortuosity. Recently published data
demonstrated a genetic association of FMD with a variant in the phosphatase and
actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1), substantiating that the pathogenesis of this
condition has genetic contribution. The renal and extracranial carotid and
vertebral arteries are most often involved, although any arterial bed may be
affected. Clinical manifestations often reflect the vascular territory affected, 
and can include hypertension, headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, myocardial
infarction, transient ischemic attack and stroke. While the gold standard for
diagnostic evaluation of FMD remains catheter-based angiography, noninvasive
imaging, including duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic angiography, and
magnetic resonance angiography, may be used for diagnosis. Treatment of FMD
depends upon symptoms as well as the nature and location of arterial lesions, but
may include both medical (blood pressure control, antiplatelet agents) and
interventional (angioplasty, stents, coils, surgery) therapies. This contemporary
analysis of the literature, combined with our own clinical experience in treating
patients with FMD, will highlight pathophysiology, evaluation, management, and
common misconceptions in the care of individuals with FMD.

OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive assessment of left ventricle (LV)
structure, and function and to detect alterations in cardiac properties in
relationship to presence, subtypes and extent of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).
METHODS: We studied 144 patients with FMD. The control group consisted of 50
matched individuals. Office and ambulatory blood pressure levels were evaluated. 
Echocardiography was employed to assess: left ventricular mass index (LVMI),
systolic function including speckle tracking echocardiography and diastolic
function assessed by mitral flow and tissue Doppler imaging.
RESULTS: There were no differences in LV morphology and function between patients
with FMD and the control group. Among 128 patients with renal FMD, there were no 
differences in LVMI and LV systolic function between patients with unifocal and
multifocal FMD. The patients with multifocal FMD were characterized by lower
early diastolic velocity (e') as compared with unifocal FMD and control groups.
However, in a multivariate regression model, e' was not independently correlated 
with FMD. There were no associations between echocardiographic indexes and
vascular involvement of FMD. Also, there were no differences in LV morphology and
function in patients with significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) compared with
patients with history of significant RAS and patients with nonsignificant RAS.
CONCLUSION: Our study in contrast to those with atherosclerotic RAS, did not show
differences in LV morphology and function between FMD patients and matched
controls. Although FMD can result in hypertension and serious vascular
complications, there is no proof that it can alter LV regardless of FMD type and 
its extent.

Spontaneous renal artery dissection (SRAD) is a rare entity with less than 200
cases reported in literature. It usually affects middle-aged men and the clinical
presentation is non-specific. Many times it is associated with conditions such as
hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitides. We report the case of a
patient who initially had renal infarct due to SRAD and then progressed to have
bowel ischaemia. The renal infarct preceded bowel ischaemia in this patient and
to the best of our knowledge this is the first such association reported in
literature. Our report emphasises the point that whenever this condition is
diagnosed in a patient one should be vigilant for other vascular disorders.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause
of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, particularly
among young women and individuals with few conventional atherosclerotic risk
factors. Patient-initiated research has spurred increased awareness of SCAD, and 
improved diagnostic capabilities and findings from large case series have led to 
changes in approaches to initial and long-term management and increasing evidence
that SCAD not only is more common than previously believed but also must be
evaluated and treated differently from atherosclerotic myocardial infarction.
High rates of recurrent SCAD; its association with female sex, pregnancy, and
physical and emotional stress triggers; and concurrent systemic arteriopathies,
particularly fibromuscular dysplasia, highlight the differences in clinical
characteristics of SCAD compared with atherosclerotic disease. Recent insights
into the causes of, clinical course of, treatment options for, outcomes of, and
associated conditions of SCAD and the many persistent knowledge gaps are
presented.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million people worldwide.
Hypertension has been related to increased risk of PAD. The treatment of elevated
blood pressure (BP) in these patients is indicated to lower the cardiovascular
risk with a BP goal of less than 130/80mmHg. Although there is no evidence that
one class of antihypertensive medication or strategy is superior for BP lowering 
in PAD, the use of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors can be effective to 
reduce the cardiovascular risk. Beta-blockers (BBs) are not contraindicated. In
the presence of carotid atherosclerosis, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) and
angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors are recommended. In fibromuscular
dysplasia the treatment of choice is percutaneous renal angioplasty. In renal
artery disease optimal medical therapy includes RAS inhibitors, CCBs, BBs and
diuretics.

Does Endothelin-1 Raise or Lower Blood Pressure in Humans?

Schiffrin EL.

Subject of Review: Gupta et al. [Cell 2017; 170: 522-533] have shown that a
genetic variant associated with the 5 vascular diseases is a distal regulator of 
endothelin (ET)-1 gene (EDN1) expression. A common single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, rs9349379, is the potential
variant responsible for increased risk of coronary artery disease, and lower risk
of migraine, carotid dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension. Since
ET-1 acts through ET type B receptors (ETBR) on endothelial cells to stimulate
the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and induce vasodilation, this may
contribute to these findings. Second Opinion: However, ET-1 has been demonstrated
to play a role in experimental and human hypertension. How can enhanced
transcription of EDN1 and translation leading to increased production of ET-1 by 
endothelial cells play a role in hypertension despite the availability of data
that suggest a hypotensive action of ET-1? This could depend on the genetic
background of individuals. In some humans, the increased ET-1 vasoconstrictor
action on ETAR and ETBR in vascular smooth muscle might predominate over the
vasodilator effects exerted via endothelial ETBR, thus resulting in elevated
blood pressure.CONCLUSION: Alternatively, hypertension could be attributed to
renal actions of ET-1. Either of these pathophysiological actions may explain a
hypertensive role of ET-1 despite a lower risk of hypertension associated with
the G allele at rs9349379, the common SNP in the PHACTR1 gene that is a distal
regulator of EDN1 and leads to an increased expression of ET-1.

Ischemic stroke has rarely been reported in association with a web of the carotid
artery. We describe here an additional case of ischemic stroke caused by a
carotid web in a young healthy woman. Detection of this vascular abnormality
required the use of CT angiography and cerebral digital subtraction angiography. 
Although there is little evidence regarding the optimal management of this
condition, under medical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy our patient
remained free of recurrent stroke events. This case report study illustrates that
the web of the carotid artery is an uncommon cause of stroke which should always 
be considered and ruled out, especially in young patients with otherwise
cryptogenic stroke. Clinicians should be aware of this condition, which
represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Subclavian artery aneurysms (SAAs) are rare and even more uncommon in patients
with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). A 20-year-old man with a past medical history
of moyamoya disease presented with an abnormal mass shadow in the apex of the
right lung on chest X-ray. Based on computed tomography imaging, a diagnosis of
right SAA was established, and an excision of the aneurysm was performed. Because
the left vertebral artery is dominant, the proximal and distal right subclavian
artery and right vertebral artery were clamped. Then, the aneurysm was excised,
and resection anastomosis was performed. Histological findings revealed FMD. The 
postsurgical course has been uneventful after 2 years. Among treatment
modalities, open surgery would be the first choice for SAAs with FMD, despite the
current era of endovascular surgeries.

In this study, we report a paediatric patient with a lethal phenotype of
respiratory distress, failure to thrive, pancreatic insufficiency, liver
dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, bone marrow suppression, humoral and
cellular immune deficiency. To identify the genetic basis of this unusual
clinical phenotype and potentially make available the option of future prenatal
testing, whole exome sequencing (WES) was used followed by functional studies in 
a bid to confirm pathogenicity. The WES we identified a homozygous novel variant,
AK298328; c.9_10insGAG; p.[Glu3dup], in NOX4 in the proband, and parental
heterozygosity for the variant (confirmed by Sanger sequencing). NADPH Oxidase 4 
NOX4 (OMIM 605261) encodes an enzyme that functions as the catalytic subunit of
the NADPH oxidase complex. NOX4 acts as an oxygen sensor, catalysing the
reduction of molecular oxygen, mainly to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However,
although, our functional data including 60% reduction in NOX4 protein levels and 
a 75% reduction in the production of H2O2 in patient fibroblast extracts compared
to controls was initially considered to be the likely cause of the phenotype in
our patient, the potential contribution of the NOX4 variant as the primary cause 
of the disease was clearly excluded based on following pieces of evidence. First,
Sanger sequencing of other family members revealed that two of the grandparents
were also homozygous for the NOX4 variant, one of who has fibromuscular
dysplasia. Second, re-evaluation of more recent variant databases revealed a high
allele frequency for this variant. Our case highlights the need to re-interrogate
bioinformatics resources as they are constantly evolving, and is reminiscent of
the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) story, where a
functional defect in fatty acid oxidation has doubtful clinical ramifications.

INTRODUCTION: Renal artery occlusive disease is poorly characterized in children;
treatments include medications, endovascular techniques, and surgery. We aimed to
describe the course of renovascular hypertension (RVH), its treatments and
outcomes.
METHODS: We performed literature review and retrospective review (1993-2014) of
children with renovascular hypertension at our institution. Response to treatment
was defined by National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on
High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents at most-recent follow-up.
RESULTS: We identified 39 patients with RVH. 54% (n=21) were male, with mean age 
of 6.93 ± 5.27 years. Most underwent endovascular treatment (n=17), with
medication alone (n=12) and surgery (n=10) less commonly utilized. Endovascular
treatment resulted in 18% cure, 65% improvement and 18% failure; surgery resulted
in 30% cure, 50% improvement and 20% failure. Medication alone resulted in 0%
cure, 75% improvement and 25% failure. 24% with endovascular treatment required
secondary endovascular intervention; 18% required secondary surgery. 20% of
patients who underwent initial surgery required reoperation for re-stenosis. Mean
follow-up was 52.2 ± 58.4 months.
CONCLUSIONS: RVH treatment in children includes medications, surgical or
endovascular approaches, with all resulting in combined 79% improvement in or
cure rates. A multidisciplinary approach and individualized patient management
are critical to optimize outcomes.

RATIONALE: Iliac arterial fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was rarely reported and
its demographic, clinical, and imaging features have not been precisely described
resulting in uncertain therapeutic methods.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old man was referred because of 3-month-ago onset
hypertension, low serum potassium, and a small-sized right kidney with normal
renal artery under ultrasound examination. This patient was suspected of primary 
aldosteronism, whereas spirolactone was poorly effective.
DIAGNOSIS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and
three-dimensional reconstruction of the whole aorta discovered an aneurysm from
the right common iliac artery (CIA) to the internal iliac artery, consistent with
a left CIA dissection and a remarkable right renal artery aneurysm before a
stenosis. Iliac and renal arteries FMD were then confirmed through digital
subtraction angiography (DSA).
INTERVENTION: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of right renal artery
was operated and a stent was deployed in left CIA.
OUTCOMES: This patient was normotensive, asymptomatic, and free from recurrence
without any antihypertensive agents at an 8-month follow-up.
LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first bilateral common and internal iliac 
arterial FMD case in China, with unique asymptomatic dissection, aneurysm, and
renovascular hypertension. Screening for secondary hypertension in young
population and for iliac or renal arterial FMD is therefore suggested with CTA
and reconstruction from neck to pelvis and MRA in those with intracranial
disorders. Among youth FMD, the potential of PTRA in renovascular hypertension
out of antihypertensive drugs and stent in dissection is novelly indicated.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous ultrasound studies in fibromuscular dysplasia
(FMD) have largely reported on color flow imaging, power Doppler, and Doppler
flow augmentation. We here report on arterial wall imaging findings by B-flow and
B-mode in patients with carotid FMD.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed ultrasonographic findings in subjects with
known or suspected FMD. All patients were evaluated with a standardized imaging
protocol including Doppler, B-mode, and B-flow. Vessel wall abnormalities were
classified as normal, luminal irregularities, or classical beading (fusiform
dilatations).
RESULTS: We identified 23 patients and 33 carotid arteries were found to be
abnormal, of which 10 had classical beading and 23 showed endoluminal
irregularities. Bilateral disease was present in 10/23 patients. In the classical
beading cases, B-mode revealed isoechoic ridges, which protruded into the lumen, 
alternating with dilated arterial segments, which were also clearly demonstrated 
by B-flow imaging. In cases with endoluminal irregularities, B-mode and B-flow
showed isoechoic subendothelial irregular thickening, which did not lead to a
fusiform dilatory appearance of the artery. The average distal internal carotid
artery peak systolic velocity of arteries with classical beading (123 ± 29
cm/second) was significantly greater than that of arteries with mild
irregularities (94 ± 34 cm/second) (P = .024).
CONCLUSION: Morphological arterial wall changes of FMD were well depicted by
careful B-flow and B-mode imaging of the distal internal carotid artery. We would
like to emphasize the utility of B-flow and B-mode in the noninvasive evaluation 
of FMD.

Carotid artery web is considered an exceptional cause of recurrent ischemic
strokes in the affected arterial territory. The underlying pathology proposed for
this entity is an atypical fibromuscular dysplasia. We present the case of a
43-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors who had experienced 2
cryptogenic ischemic strokes in the same arterial territory within an 11-month
period. Although all diagnostic tests initially yielded normal results, detailed 
analysis of the computed tomography angiography images revealed a carotid web;
catheter angiography subsequently confirmed the diagnosis. Carotid surgery was
performed, since which time the patient has remained completely asymptomatic. The
histological finding of intimal hyperplasia is consistent with previously
reported cases of carotid artery web. Carotid artery web is an infrequent cause
of stroke, and this diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion plus a detailed 
analysis of vascular imaging studies.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare entity that can cause
acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death (SCD) which often goes
unrecognized. We report a case of SCAD in a young postpartum female who presented
with sudden cardiac arrest. The patient was managed medically and found to have
fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). After being stabilized in the critical care unit, 
coronary angiography was performed which showed dissection of the left main
artery, intramural hematoma, and the culprit lesion. Further investigation showed
dissection of the left vertebral artery which was all consistent with a diagnosis
of FMD. The patient was followed as an outpatient and a repeated coronary
angiography demonstrated healed dissection site. In conclusion, this case
exemplifies that prompt diagnosis along with medical management without the need 
of coronary artery bypass graft, and percutaneous coronary intervention can
improve survival in SCAD.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) continues to be understudied, underdiagnosed, and
undertreated in women. Gender and age bias complicate the evaluation of women
with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). As a result, conditions like spontaneous
coronary artery dissection (SCAD) are often missed. SCAD is an infrequent yet
important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) with a predilection for young to
middle aged women. The condition is thought to be under-reported, likely a result
of both low index of suspicion as well as an unfamiliarity with SCAD's
angiographic variants. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)
detailed an assessment pathway for patients with myocardial infarction with
non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), a subset of which includes patients
with SCAD. The pathway highlights the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in
addition to intracoronary imaging for increased diagnostic yield. Early and
proper diagnosis is crucial in SCAD given the potential for sudden cardiac death,
as well as the increased risk for future cardiac events including recurrent
dissection. In addition, SCAD has frequently been associated with underlying
connective tissue disease and/or arteriopathy, most commonly fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD), which requires careful screening. The lack of consensus on
investigation or treatment highlights the need for increased awareness and
further research to better understand this challenging entity.

BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is caused by reactivation of the
herpes simplex virus in the trigeminal nerve. HZO-initiated cerebral vasculopathy
is well characterized; however, there are no documented cases that report the
efficacy of surgical revascularization for improving cerebral hemodynamics
following progressive HZO-induced vasculopathy. We present a case in which
quantitative anatomic and hemodynamic imaging were performed longitudinally
before and after surgical revascularization in a patient with HZO and
vasculopathic changes.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female with history of right-sided HZO presented 
with left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria and multiple acute infarcts.
Angiography performed serially over a 2-month duration revealed progressive
middle cerebral artery stenosis, development of new moyamoya-like
lenticulostriate collaterals, and evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in cervical
portions of the internal carotid artery. Hemodynamic imaging revealed right
hemisphere decreased blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. In addition
to medical therapy, right-sided surgical revascularization was performed with the
intent to reestablish blood flow. Follow-up imaging 13 months post
revascularization demonstrated improved blood flow and vascular reserve capacity 
in the operative hemisphere, which paralleled symptom resolution.
CONCLUSIONS: HZO can lead to progressive, symptomatic intracranial stenoses. This
report suggests that surgical revascularization techniques can improve cerebral
hemodynamics and symptomatology in patients with aggressive disease when medical 
management is unsuccessful; similar procedures could be considered in managing
HZO patients with advanced or progressive vasculopathy.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe 27 patients with 32 web vessels 
(WVs) from our practice and provide a review of the literature regarding imaging 
diagnostics, clinical presentation, and treatment of WVs.
METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using combinations of the following
terms: "stroke in young adults," "web," "recurrent stroke," "diaphragm-like,"
"atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia," "atypical fibromuscular dysplasia," "septal
fibromuscular dysplasia," "septa," "diaphragms," "pseudovalvular folds," and
"carotid diaphragm." Our series was added in this review.
RESULTS: According to location, there were 88 carotid WVs (91.66%), 7 vertebral
WVs (7.3%), and 1 subclavian WV (1.04%). According to clinical presentation, the 
reported WVs caused stroke in 81 cases (84.38%). Treatment was supportive care in
46 cases (47.91%), surgery in 33 cases (35.41%), and an endovascular procedure
through angioplasty and stenting in 17 cases (17.7%). Variables such as age (P = 
0.7565), sex (P = 0.6912), and location (P = 0.7993) were not shown to be risk
factors for stroke in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although few cases have been reported in the literature, the stroke 
rate in patients with WVs is high. Endovascular treatment is presented as an
effective form of treatment with no associated morbidities or recurrences of
ischemic events.

Background  There have been studies trying to characterize Fibromuscular
Dysplasia (FMD); however, most of them are based in mainly non-Hispanic sample.
The objective of this study is to better understand the epidemiology and clinical
characteristics of craniocervical FMD in the Hispanic population. Methods  We
retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiograms performed in our center in a
period of 3.5 years under any indication looking for angiographic patterns of
FMD. Exclusion criteria consisted of cases in which the first angiogram was done 
when the patients were younger than 18 years. Patients were subdivided based on
those with FMD and those without it for baseline characteristics and were looked 
for any associations. We further compared the same baseline characteristics among
Hispanic FMD and non-Hispanic FMD population. A chart review was conducted
looking for clinical features and vascular events. Results  We analyzed 448
angiograms among patients younger than 18 years. We identified 47 patients with
evidence of FMD involving the cervical arteries and 401 patients without FMD. Of 
the 47 patients with FMD in our neuroendovascular registry, we found that 76.6%
were women and 57.4% were Hispanics. There was no statistical significant
difference when comparing the variables across ethnicities, except history of
cigarette smoking and dyslipidemia. The most common associated supra-aortic
arterial lesions seen in the FMD group were intracranial aneurysm and arterial
dissections. We then used same variables to compare Hispanic FMD with
non-Hispanic FMD. We have found that there has been a positive association of
cigarette smoking and dyslipidemia with FMD ( p ≤ 0.05). Conclusion  Our study
suggests that FMD affecting the carotid and vertebral arteries has similar
demographic pattern across ethnicities in the United States. In Hispanics, the
disease appears to have a predilection for women and history of cigarette
smoking. Intracranial aneurysm and arterial dissection were the most commonly
associated arterial lesions.

Background Smooth muscle differentiation ("adventitial fibromuscular dysplasia," 
AFD) was purported as specific to arteries in the transition zone of Hirschsprung
disease (HSCR) patients. We investigated AFD in an HSCR population and controls
and consider the pathogenesis and significance of the vascular pathology. Design 
Vascular histology in sections from colonic HSCR resections (n = 55) was compared
with age- and site-matched controls with (n = 19) and without (n = 28) non-HSCR
obstructive conditions. Vascular pathology was mapped, and correlations were
sought between the vascular findings and bowel distension, inflammation,
neuromuscular anatomy, preoperative clinical variables, and postsurgical
complications. Results One of 2 forms of AFD was identified in 42% (23/55) of the
HSCR resections: the previously described "mature" form with adventitial bundles 
of differentiated smooth muscle cells (7/23, all submucosal) and a newly
described "immature" AFD characterized by densely packed myofibroblasts in the
arterial adventitia (16/23, 3 submucosal, 3 serosal, and 10 both). Adventitial
inflammation and/or medial necrosis was present in the immature form (6/16).
Mature submucosal AFD was present in 2/28 (7.1%) nonobstructive and 5/19 (26%)
obstructive non-HSCR controls ( P = .10). Immature AFD was only found in less
than 1-month-olds, and mature AFD only in older patients, including the 7
affected controls. AFD did not correlate with sex, syndromic status, length of
the aganglionic segment, or postoperative complications. AFD was present in
grossly dilated (17/23) and narrowed (10/23) regions and in the aganglionic
(2/23), ganglionic (14/23), or both (7/23) segments. In several cases, AFD
existed proximal to the histological transition zone. Conclusion AFD occurs in
HSCR and other obstructive conditions but is significantly less common in the
colons of patients with no history of dysmotility. The pathology likely
progresses from a reversible accumulation of myofibroblasts in neonates to a
stable population of mature smooth muscle cells. The distribution of vascular
lesions does not correlate with neuropathological findings and suggests a
nonspecific form of vascular injury, possibly related to bowel distension. AFD in
HSCR resections has not been shown to be clinically significant and should not
influence management.

A carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is an abnormal communication between arteries
and veins within the cavernous sinus and may be classified as either direct or
dural. Direct CCFs are characterized by a direct connection between the internal 
carotid artery (ICA) and the cavernous sinus, whereas dural CCFs result from an
indirect connection involving cavernous arterial branches and the cavernous
sinus. Direct CCFs frequently are traumatic in origin and also may be caused by
rupture of an ICA aneurysm within the cavernous sinus, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
type IV, or iatrogenic intervention. Causes of dural CCFs include hypertension,
fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos type IV, and dissection of the ICA.
Evaluation of a suspected CCF often involves non-invasive imaging techniques,
including standard tonometry, pneumotonometry, ultrasound, computed tomographic
scanning and angiography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, but 
the gold standard for classification and diagnosis remains digital subtraction
angiography. When a direct CCF is confirmed, first-line treatment is endovascular
intervention, which may be accomplished using detachable balloons, coils, liquid 
embolic agents, or a combination of these tools. As dural CCFs often resolve
spontaneously, low-risk cases may be managed conservatively. When invasive
treatment is warranted, endovascular intervention or stereotactic radiosurgery
may be performed. Modern endovascular techniques offer the ability to
successfully treat CCFs with a low morbidity and virtually no mortality.

In this paper, we report the autopsy findings of a 42-year-old White male who was
found deceased at his home by his brother in the early morning hours with a
history of excessive alcohol consumption 1 day before his death. A medical record
review revealed chronic alcohol use with alcohol dependence syndrome,
hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias by electrocardiogram 2 years prior.
External examination revealed only a single bruise on the forehead. Internal
examination revealed changes associated with chronic alcohol abuse and mild
atherosclerosis. The lack of a cause of death at autopsy resulted in a dissection
of the cardiac conduction system and the detection of a small cystic lesion at
the atrioventricular node region. Microscopic examination revealed a cystic tumor
of the atrioventricular node and fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary artery
branches near the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Based on the case
history and autopsy findings, death was attributed to a fatal cardiac arrhythmia 
due to cystic tumor of the atrioventricular node with fibromuscular dysplasia of 
the coronary artery branches near the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes a
possible contributing factor.

Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension.
Elderly patients with atherosclerosis and young women with fibromuscular
dysplasia (FMD) are particularly at risk. Blood pressure screening is often key
to this diagnosis, although the reliability of clinical screening has been
questioned, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) likely offers
superior ability to diagnose poorly controlled hypertension. In patients with
RAS, medical management should be the primary means of therapy; however, in a
select group of these patients, renal revascularization may be considered, and
has been shown to reduce blood pressure and stabilize chronic kidney disease. In 
this report, we present a patient diagnosed with RAS due to FMD, found to have
significant hypertension via ABPM, and treated successfully with percutaneous
renal artery angioplasty; importantly, continuous 24-hr ambulatory monitoring
after pressure gradient guided renal angioplasty confirmed reduction in blood
pressure.

BACKGROUND: Renal infarction can cause abrupt and severe hypertension and less
frequently renal failure. Renal infarction results from disruption of renal blood
flow in the main ipsilateral renal artery or in a segmental branch. Underlying
mechanism is either general, 'embolic' or 'thrombophilic', or local related to
primary 'renal artery lesion'. It depends on various causes. In absence of an
identified cause, renal infarction is classified as 'idiopathic'. Previous
studies report a significant number of 'idiopathic' renal infarction.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze various renal infarction causes.
METHODS: Between July 2000 and June 2015, 259 consecutive patients with renal
infarction were admitted to our hospital center and retrospectively identified
from weekly multidisciplinary round. Main clinical and biological characteristics
were extracted from clinical data warehouse. Renal imaging was reviewed by two
readers unaware of the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of 259 initially identified patients, 30 were excluded owing to a lack
of imaging or clinical data and 43 because iatrogenic renal infarction. In the
186 studied patients, dissection was observed in 76 patients (40.8%) and
occlusion in 75 (40.3%). Renal infarction mechanisms were 'renal artery lesion'
(n = 151; 81.2%), 'embolic' (n = 17; 9.1%), 'thrombophilic' (n = 11; 5.9%) and
'idiopathic' (n = 7; 3.8%). Predominant renal artery lesions were atherosclerosis
disease (n = 52; 34.4%) followed by dissecting hematoma (n = 35; 23.2%) and
fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 29; 19.2%). Right and left kidneys were equally
involved.
CONCLUSION: Renal artery lesion is the most frequent cause of renal infarction.
This result underlines the need for extensive arterial exploration to identify
the renal infarction mechanism and, in case of renal artery lesion, the
underlying vascular disease.

AIMS: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an under-recognised and
important cause of myocardial infarction in young women. Recurrent SCAD is
frequent but poorly understood. We aimed to explore the clinical and angiographic
characteristics, and outcomes of recurrent SCAD.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with SCAD extension or recurrence prospectively
followed at Vancouver General Hospital were included in this retrospective study.
SCAD diagnosis was confirmed by two experienced cardiologists. Detailed medical
history, baseline demographics, angiographic results, and clinical details of
index SCAD and recurrent events were recorded. SCAD extension was defined as
angiographic extension of a previously dissected coronary segment, and de novo
recurrent SCAD was defined as new spontaneous dissection. We identified 43
patients with SCAD recurrence with mean age 48.9±8.4 years; 38/43 were women, and
32/43 had fibromuscular dysplasia. Nine patients had SCAD extension at median
time of five (1-19) days, while 34 patients had de novo recurrent SCAD at median 
time of 1,487 (107- 6,461) days after the index SCAD event. All SCAD extension
patients had worsening of the index dissected segment, with 5/9 involving
extension to adjacent segments, while all de novo recurrent SCAD patients had new
dissections affecting coronary segments distinct from the index dissection.
CONCLUSIONS: De novo recurrent SCAD invariably affected new segments distinct
from previously dissected segments.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection or SCAD is a rare and challenging disease 
that is increasingly diagnosed. It is characterized by a non-traumatic,
non-iatrogenic separation of the coronary artery wall and occurs predominantly in
young and middle-aged women without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. SCAD
is often associated with predisposing conditions such as the peripartum period,
systemic inflammatory disease and heritable connective tissue disease. More
recently, independent investigators have demonstrated an important association
with fibromuscular dysplasia. Extreme emotional or physical stress as well as
intense hormonal therapy or drug abuse have been pointed out as precipitating
factors. The diagnosis of SCAD can be challenging and starts with clinical
suspicion. Advanced imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound and
optical coherence tomography are useful for the differentiation from
atherosclerotic disease and are increasingly used for this indication. The
proposed treatment in the acute setting is based on findings from single-centre
retrospective series: in stable patients with a TIMI-flow ≥2 a conservative
management is proposed because of the high risk of procedural failure and
complications as well as a high probability of spontaneous healing. Long-term
treatment is comparable to that in non-SCAD acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but
dual antiplatelet therapy should only be started in case of stenting and should
be kept as short as possible in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
Prognosis seems to be better compared to non-SCAD ACS but there is a reasonable
risk of recurrence. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of SCAD and 
provide a clinical pathway for the diagnosis, management and work-up of SCAD
patients.

PURPOSE: To compare the performance of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with 
1M gadobutrol, a high relaxivity macrocyclic contrast agent, to 2D time-of-flight
MRA (ToF-MRA) using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as the standard of
reference. Primary objectives were evaluation for superiority of structural
delineation and noninferiority for detection and exclusion of clinically
significant disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 315 subjects underwent unenhanced and
contrast-enhanced MRA with 1M gadobutrol (CE-MRA) and were scanned with 1.5T MRI 
equipped with an at least 6-element body coil. Evaluations were based on both
centralized blinded read (BR) performed by six readers as well as investigator
site interpretations for the 292 subjects who completed the study. Quantitative
evaluations including percent stenosis and normal vessel measurements were also
performed. Secondary endpoints included identification of accessory renal
arteries, diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), diagnostic confidence, and 
need for additional imaging.
RESULTS: A total of 292 patients suspected of renal artery disease completed the 
study. CE-MRA demonstrated statistically significant improvement in assessability
of vascular segments compared to ToF: 95.9% vs. 77.6% (P < 0.0001). In the BR,
the sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRA were noninferior to ToF-MRA (53.4% vs. 
46.6% and 95.1% vs. 85.7%, respectively). There was less error in the CE-MRA
stenosis measurements (0.15 mm gadobutrol vs. 0.41 mm ToF, P < 0.05). FMD was
correctly diagnosed more frequently, 10% more accessory renal arteries were
identified (P < 0.01), diagnostic confidence increased (P < 0.01), and fewer
additional imaging studies were recommended (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Gadobutrol-enhanced MRA of the renal arteries has superior
visualization, more accurate vessel measurements, and may serve as a CTA
alternative without any ionizing radiation.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic and non-inflammatory vascular
disease with primary lesion of renal and internal carotid arteries. We present a 
neonatal case of fibromuscular dysplasia who died on the second day of life. The 
newborn suffered from fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary arteries and a
congenital heart defect. The interesting feature of this case was the formation
of aneurysms of the coronary arteries with pulmonary atresia. This case
demonstrates a casuistically rare form of association between fibromuscular
dysplasia of the coronary arteries and pulmonary artery atresia.

Background Hemicrania continua (HC) -like headaches have been rarely reported as 
symptomatic headaches, including cases secondary to cervical artery dissection.
Case series We present five cases of HC-like headaches following cervical artery 
dissection, in three cases with specific indomethacin response. In two cases,
comorbidity of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was noted. Conclusion Carotid artery
dissection may result in an HC-like headache syndrome. A specific response to
indomethacin does not rule out dissection as underlying pathology. Screening for 
extracranial manifestations of FMD should be considered, especially in
middle-aged females.

BACKGROUND: Carotid artery dissections have long been associated with compromise 
of the structural integrity of the arterial wall from heritable connective-tissue
disorders, hypertension, and trauma. However, an association between spontaneous 
internal carotid artery dissection and tortuous or redundant carotid anatomy has 
not been fully explored.
METHODS: Patients with CTA confirmed spontaneous cervical internal carotid artery
dissections were compared to a group of age and sex matched controls who also
received CTA of the neck. Patients with trauma or aortic dissections were
excluded. Five radiologists reviewed the CTA images to evaluate internal carotid 
artery tortuosity (reported as loops, kinks or coils), retrojugular and
retropharyngeal courses of the internal carotid artery, presence of fibromuscular
dysplasia and presence of atherosclerotic disease. Baseline data collected
included demographic characteristics (sex, age, smoking history) and
cardiovascular comorbidities.
RESULTS: A total of 83 cervical internal carotid artery dissection and their age 
and sex matched controls were included in this study. 46% of patients were female
in each group and mean age was 49.2±10.6 years. The presence of any carotid
tortuosity was 53% (N.=44) and 34% (N.=28) in the per-patient analysis of
dissection and control groups, respectively (P=0.02). Loops were reported in 22% 
(N.=18) of dissection patients and 8% (N.=7) of controls (P=0.03). Retrojugular
course of the internal carotid artery were seen in 23% (N.=38) of dissection
patients and 9% (N.=15) of controls (P=0.0009) in the per-vessel analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that there is an association between the presence
of tortuous carotid artery anatomy and spontaneous carotid artery dissection.
This finding emphasizes the importance of the presence of tortuous arteries on
CTA imaging to increase the index of suspicion for a potential dissection.
