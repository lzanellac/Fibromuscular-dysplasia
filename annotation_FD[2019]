30621952|t|Association of the PHACTR1/EDN1 Genetic Locus With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.
30621952|a|BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) afflicting predominantly younger to middle-aged women. Observational studies have reported a high prevalence of extracoronary vascular anomalies, especially fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and a low prevalence of coincidental cases of atherosclerosis. PHACTR1/EDN1 is a genetic risk locus for several vascular diseases, including FMD and coronary artery disease, with the putative causal noncoding variant at the rs9349379 locus acting as a potential enhancer for the endothelin-1 (EDN1) gene. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to test the association between the rs9349379 genotype and SCAD. METHODS: Results from case control studies from France, United Kingdom, United States, and Australia were analyzed to test the association with SCAD risk, including age at first event, pregnancy-associated SCAD (P-SCAD), and recurrent SCAD. RESULTS: The previously reported risk allele for FMD (rs9349379-A) was associated with a higher risk of SCAD in all studies. In a meta-analysis of 1,055 SCAD patients and 7,190 controls, the odds ratio (OR) was 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50 to 1.86) per copy of rs9349379-A. In a subset of 491 SCAD patients, the OR estimate was found to be higher for the association with SCAD in patients without FMD (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.33) than in SCAD cases with FMD (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.99). There was no effect of genotype on age at first event, P-SCAD, or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The first genetic risk factor for SCAD was identified in the largest study conducted to date for this condition. This genetic link may contribute to the clinical overlap between SCAD and FMD.

30623691|t|Cervical artery dissection: fibromuscular dysplasia versus vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
30623691|a|We report the case of a 42-year-old patient referred for suspicion of fibromuscular dysplasia in the context of a carotid artery dissection occurring after a minor trauma. Initial complaints included left hemicrania, lateral diplopia with left 6th cranial nerve palsy and pulsatile tinnitus. The work-up disclosed a large left carotid-cavernous fistula, as well as more proximal carotid lesions compatible with multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia. Personal history included colonic and uterine perforation. Family history disclosed a fatal hemorrhage due to rupture of a splenic artery aneurysm in the father and an iliac dissection in the sister. Genetic screening revealed a mutation in exon 6 of the COL3A1 gene in the index patient and her sister, confirming the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). This case report shows that images suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia may be found in patients with demonstrated vEDS. Furthermore, it reminds that in case of cervical artery dissection occurring in a young patient, all efforts should be made to diagnose the underlying condition. In particular, the existence of a family history of arterial dissection, the occurrence of a carotid-cavernous fistula and coexistence with other complications suggestive of a connective tissue disease should prompt physicians to consider the diagnosis of vEDS.

30624987|t|Deep Vascular Phenotyping in Patients With Renal Multifocal Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
30624987|a|Arterial fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease, whose pathophysiology is still unknown. We performed deep image-based vascular phenotyping of nonaffected arteries to look for systemic vascular alterations in fibromuscular dysplasia. This single center cross-sectional study included 50 patients with multifocal renal fibromuscular dysplasia, 50 hypertensive patients, and 50 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and ethnicity; hypertensive patients were matched also for blood pressure. Brachial artery endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent dilation were studied by echotracking. Aortic stiffness was assessed by carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity. We quantified the presence of supernumerary acoustic interfaces within the common carotid wall by the triple signal (TS) score. We plotted the Young incremental elastic modulus/stress curves for common carotid artery, derived from echotracking and tonometry. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia had impaired endothelium-independent dilation (adjusted P=0.002), smaller brachial artery diameter but comparable endothelium-dependent dilation and aortic stiffness. The prevalence of TS score &gt;6 was 56%, 40%, 24% in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, hypertensives, and controls, respectively ( P=0.005). Fibromuscular dysplasia remained significantly associated with TS in the multiple regression model ( P=0.022). Impaired endothelium-dependent dilation was present only in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, TS score &gt;6 ( P=0.047). Incremental elastic modulus was higher for a given wall stress (80 kPa) in the presence of a TS score &gt;6, especially in fibromuscular dysplasia. In conclusion, nonclinically affected large- and medium-sized arteries in patients with multifocal renal fibromuscular dysplasia exhibit a cluster of diffuse alterations in smooth muscle cell function, arterial geometry, wall characteristics, and mechanical properties.

30642276|t|Bilateral renal artery stenosis as a cause of refractory intradialytic hypertension in a patient with end stage renal disease.
30642276|a|BACKGROUND: We report a 61-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to polycystic kidney disease (PKD) complicated by intradialytic hypertension (IDH). Increased sympathetic drive leading to increased stroke volume and/or vasoconstriction with an inappropriate increase in peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) has been postulated to be the cause of IDH. CASE PRESENTATION: Attempts to control her blood pressure by reducing her goal weight; increasing dialysis times/ frequency and decreasing her sodium concentrate in the dialysis fluid were unsuccessful. Acting upon literature evidence suggesting renovascular disease as a cause of IDH, we referred her to an interventional radiologist for evaluation of the renal arteries. Selective angiogram of both renal arteries revealed right sided atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) treated with insertion of a balloon mounted 6 mm stent and left sided fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) treated with 5 mm balloon angioplasty. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the need for interrogating the renal arteries radiologically for a potential cause in difficult to control IDH and comments on the association between PKD and FMD that has not yet been reported.

30678834|t|Prevalence, Presentation, and Associated Conditions of Patients With Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
30678834|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is defined by focal narrowing of small and medium-sized arteries due to an idiopathic, noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. The population-based prevalence of FMD remains unknown. Using the National Inpatient Sample database, we evaluated the prevalence, clinical presentation, mortality, and associated conditions of FMD from January 1, 2004, to September 30, 2015. Among 2,420 patients who presented with FMD, 2,086 (86.20%) of patients were female. The mean age was 55.18 +- 18.99 years in men and 63.37 +- 17.10 years in women. FMD patients most commonly presented with hypertension (67.3%), transient ischemic attack (3.7%), headache (2.1%), dizziness (1.1%), abdominal pain (0.6%), or hematuria (0.3%). In-hospital mortality of FMD patients was 0.74%. In conclusion, FMD is a rare condition with low in-hospital mortality that may be considered among female patients presenting with hypertension.

30684142|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissections and associated predisposing factors: a narrative review.
30684142|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) represents around 25% of cases of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in women aged 40-65 years who have few or no traditional cardiovascular risk factors. It is assumed that the incidence is underestimated, as the angiographic appearance of SCAD may often mimic atherosclerosis. This review aims to examine SCAD by focusing on the associated predisposing factors and precipitating stressors in this heterogeneous patient population, as well as the best treatment approach and the prognosis. Progressive knowledge has improved our current understanding of SCAD, but more awareness among clinicians is necessary. Recently, two position papers from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have been released, which will be summarised in brief.

30698711|t|Canadian spontaneous coronary artery dissection cohort study: in-hospital and 30-day outcomes.
30698711|a|AIMS: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) was underdiagnosed and poorly understood for decades. It is increasingly recognized as an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in women. We aimed to assess the natural history of SCAD, which has not been adequately explored. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a multicentre, prospective, observational study of patients with non-atherosclerotic SCAD presenting acutely from 22 centres in North America. Institutional ethics approval and patient consents were obtained. We recorded baseline demographics, in-hospital characteristics, precipitating/predisposing conditions, angiographic features (assessed by core laboratory), in-hospital major adverse events (MAE), and 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We prospectively enrolled 750 SCAD patients from June 2014 to June 2018. Mean age was 51.8 +- 10.2 years, 88.5% were women (55.0% postmenopausal), 87.7% were Caucasian, and 33.9% had no cardiac risk factors. Emotional stress was reported in 50.3%, and physical stress in 28.9% (9.8% lifting &gt;50 pounds). Predisposing conditions included fibromuscular dysplasia 31.1% (45.2% had no/incomplete screening), systemic inflammatory diseases 4.7%, peripartum 4.5%, and connective tissue disorders 3.6%. Most were treated conservatively (84.3%), but 14.1% underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and 0.7% coronary artery bypass surgery. In-hospital composite MAE was 8.8%; peripartum SCAD patients had higher in-hospital MAE (20.6% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.023). Overall 30-day MACE was 8.8%. Peripartum SCAD and connective tissue disease were independent predictors of 30-day MACE. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection predominantly affects women and presents with MI. Despite majority of patients being treated conservatively, survival was good. However, significant cardiovascular complications occurred within 30 days. Long-term follow-up and further investigations on management are warranted.

30706611|t|Heritable disorders of connective tissue: Description of a data repository and initial cohort characterization.
30706611|a|We describe a data repository on heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCT) assembled by the National Institutes of Health's National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program between 2001 and 2013. Participants included affected persons with a wide range of heritable connective tissue phenotypes, and unaffected family members. Elements include comprehensive history and physical examination, standardized laboratory data, physiologic measures and imaging, standardized patient-reported outcome measures, and an extensive linked biorepository. The NIA made a commitment to make the repository available to extramural investigators and deposited samples at Coriell Tissue Repository (N = 126) and GenTAC registry (N = 132). The clinical dataset was transferred to Penn State University College of Medicine Clinical and Translational Science Institute in 2016, and data elements inventoried. The consented cohort of 1,009 participants averaged 39 +- 18 years (mean +- SD, range 2-95) at consent; gender distribution is 71% F and 83% self-report Caucasian ethnicity. Diagnostic categories include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (classical N = 50, hypermobile N = 99, vascular N = 101, rare types and unclassified N = 178), Marfan syndrome (N = 33), Stickler syndrome (N = 60), fibromuscular dysplasia (N = 135), Other HDCT (N = 72). Unaffected family members (N = 218) contributed DNA for the molecular archive only. We aim to develop further discrete data from unstructured elements, analyze multisymptom HDCT manifestations, encourage data use by other researchers and thereby better understand the complexity of these high-morbidity conditions and their multifaceted effects on affected persons.

30731330|t|Intraesophageal aortopulmonary collateral artery occlusion in an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot and flow-dependent major aortopulmonary collateral arteries.
30731330|a|Patients with flow-dependent aortopulmonary collateral arteries often exhibit tenuous clinical statuses. Here we present an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA) and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) who experienced clinically significant oxygen desaturations during feedings. These frequent episodes were attributed to gastroesophageal reflux. In preparation for possible surgical correction of her complex congenital heart condition, she was intubated for a cardiac catheterization to better characterize her anatomy, but terminally decompensated shortly after extubation and restarting feeding. On autopsy, very mild evidence of esophageal reflux was present; instead, one of her four aortopulmonary collateral arteries was unexpectedly discovered traversing through the muscular layer of her esophageal wall. This finding was confirmed microscopically with significant intimal hyperplasia compared to uninvolved collateral arteries. The remainder of the autopsy findings, including her myocardium, lungs, and esophagus, were unremarkable. Given the feeding-associated oxygen desaturations present in life and the aberrant collateral artery's comparative stenosis at death, we speculate that the repetitive trauma of esophageal peristalsis was not only significant enough to temporarily impact oxygenation but, over time, led to near-occlusion of the intraesophageal collateral artery, which may have contributed to the terminal decompensation of this already tenuous patient.

30739593|t|High incidence and clinical characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissection: The ARCADIA-POL study.
30739593|a|The association between fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and spontaneous cervical artery dissection (SCeAD) has been recognized, but the available evidence on this relationship is scant. Therefore, the main goal of our study was to systematically evaluate FMD frequency, clinical characteristics and vascular bed involvement in patients with SCeAD. Among 230 patients referred to the ARCADIA-POL study, 43 patients (mean age 44.1 +- 8.9 years; 15 men and 28 women) with SCeAD were referred. Also, 135 patients with FMD were compared to patients with and without SCeAD. Patients underwent: ambulatory blood pressure measurements, biochemical evaluation, echocardiographic examination, and whole body computed tomographic angiography. FMD changes were found in 39.5% of patients with SCeAD. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between patients with SCeAD and FMD and those without FMD, except for a tendency towards a higher female ratio in SCeAD patients with FMD. There were no differences in other parameters describing target organ and SCeAD characteristics. Patients with SCeAD and FMD compared to those without SCeAD were characterized by a lower frequency of hypertension and a higher frequency of hyperlipidemia and history of contraceptive hormone use. Our study indicates a high incidence (39.5%) of FMD in subjects with SCeAD. Since there are no distinctive discriminating factors between patients with SCeAD and FMD and those without FMD, FMD should be suspected in all patients with SCeAD.

30769066|t|Ruptured Superior Mesenteric Artery Aneurysm due to Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Rare Vascular Presentation in a Patient with Schizophrenia.
30769066|a|Visceral aneurysms are rare entities, with a reported incidence of 0.01-2%. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic, noninflammatory artery disease, which may predispose to aneurysmal degeneration. Schizophrenia has been linked to an increased cardiovascular risk because of the influence of traditional and disease-specific risk factors. We report the case of a 44-year-old male schizophrenic patient presenting with a ruptured giant aneurysm of superior mesenteric artery, managed by mesenteric ligation. The histologic diagnosis was fibromuscular dysplasia. Another case of visceral aneurysm in schizophrenic patient with similar histologic features has been previously reported in literature.

30771026|t|Pathology of the carotid space.
30771026|a|The complex anatomy of the carotid space within a small confined area is unique to the head and neck and allows for a vast array of pathology. This paper will review the anatomy of the carotid space from the skull base to the thorax, defining its borders at multiple levels, as well as its contents. The paper will also describe the myriad of mass lesions and vascular pathologies that may occur within the carotid space. The discussion will include anatomic considerations in differential diagnoses, imaging features, and lesion characteristics across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, ultrasound, and conventional angiography. Entities discussed include paragangliomas, nerve sheath tumors, meningioma, fibromuscular dysplasia, carotidynia, thrombus, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, and pathology of the deep cervical chain lymph nodes. Understanding the complex and unique anatomy of the carotid space, as well as the nuances of navigating a broad differential, will empower the reader to make an accurate diagnosis.

30787570|t|Outcome following renal autotransplantation in renal artery stenosis.
30787570|a|Introduction: With significant advances in the area of interventional radiology, angioplasty and stenting have become preferred first-line treatment in patients with significant renal artery stenosis. However, not all patients have favorable anatomy to undergo minimally invasive treatments, and reconstruction of the renal artery is an option. In select cases, either improved renal function or maintenance of existing function and sometimes resolution of hypertension can follow surgical treatment. Material and Methods: This was a prospective observational study conducted from August 2010 to June 2016. Patients &lt;45 years of age with uncontrolled hypertension secondary to renovascular hypertension (RVH) and refractory to medical management and renal arterial disease unfavorable for percutaneous intervention were included in the study. All patients were evaluated thoroughly using computed tomography angiography and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scan. Patients underwent autotransplantation either into the right or left iliac fossa. Some kidneys required bench reconstruction of the renal artery and/or its branches before being implanted into either iliac fossa. Results: Nine patients were included in the study. The mean age was 27 years. Seven were males and two were females. Five patients had bilateral renal artery stenosis. After autotransplantation, initially five patients became free of antihypertensive medicines, but on the follow-up, two patients showed rising trend of blood pressure. The evaluation revealed narrowing at anastomosis site in both patients with salvageable kidney function in one patient. Angioplasty with stenting was done in this patient while the second patient underwent secondary nephrectomy. At 2 years of follow-up, four patients required no antihypertensive medicines. Conclusion: Autotransplantation can be a successful treatment of severe RVH and should be considered in patients with renal arterial disease unfavorable for percutaneous intervention.

30808101|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia affects the muscles of small and medium-sized arteries. The aetiology of the condition is unknown; it is most frequently seen in middle-aged women, but can affect both sexes at any age. Hypertension is the most common clinical manifestation when the renal arteries are affected. The diagnosis is made based on clinical suspicion and specific angiographic findings. The treatment is aimed at normalisation of blood pressure with the aid of drugs or through revacularisation.

30826233|t|Natural History of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection With Spontaneous Angiographic Healing.
30826233|a|OBJECTIVES: Given the uncertainty regarding the degree and prevalence of spontaneous healing following spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), the aim of this study was to assess the angiographic characteristics of the dissected segments in a large cohort of patients with SCAD who underwent subsequent repeat coronary angiography. BACKGROUND: SCAD is an uncommon yet important cause of myocardial infarction in women. Very little is known about the characteristics of healing of dissected arteries. METHODS: Patients with nonatherosclerotic SCAD followed prospectively at Vancouver General Hospital who underwent repeat angiography were included in this study. Those who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for SCAD were excluded. Baseline patient demographics and in-hospital and long-term cardiovascular events were recorded. Angiographic characteristics of the SCAD artery at index and repeat angiography were assessed by 2 experienced angiographers. Criteria for angiographic healing were as follows: 1) improvement of stenosis severity from index event; 2) residual stenosis &lt;50%; and 3) TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 3. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-six patients with 182 noncontiguous SCAD lesions were included. The mean age was 51.5 +- 8.7 years, 88.5% were women, 83.3% were Caucasian, and 75.6% had fibromuscular dysplasia. All patients presented with myocardial infarction. At index angiography, type 2 SCAD was most commonly observed, in 126 of 182 lesions (69.2%); TIMI flow grade &lt;3 was present in 85 of 182 (46.7%); and median lesion stenosis was 79.0% (interquartile range: 56.0% to 100%). Median time to repeat angiography was 154 days (interquartile range: 70 to 604 days), with median residual lesion stenosis improving to 25.5% (interquartile range: 12.0 to 38.8 days), and TIMI flow grade &lt;3 observed in 10 of 182 lesions (5.5%). Angiographic healing occurred in 157 of 182 lesions (86.3%). Of repeat angiography performed &gt;=30 days post-SCAD, 152 of 160 (95%) showed spontaneous angiographic healing. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of coronary arteries affected by SCAD heal spontaneously on repeat angiography, with apparent time dependency, with the vast majority having complete healing after 30 days from the SCAD event.

30844837|t|Arrhythmogenic Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Associated With Fibromuscular Dysplasia of Ostial Right Main Coronary Artery.
30844837|a|In this article, we report the autopsy findings of a 23-year-old woman, who was found unconscious at home by her relatives. During the transportation to the hospital, the woman was handed over to the ambulance personnel, who were the first to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In the hospital, after an hour-lasting asystole, the heart activity was restored. Prolonged cardiac arrest led to hypoxic brain injury, which resulted in a persistent coma. Examinations carried out during hospitalization detected hypokinetic interventricular septum, frequent ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular fibrillation. The patient died within 35 hours of admission to the hospital. Gross findings of the heart included a noticeable increase of the adipose tissue in the right ventricular wall, where histologically focal myocardial atrophy with focal transmural lipomatosis reaching endocardium were detected. Death was attributed to arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy. Pathogenic variants in JUP gene and KCNH2 gene confirmed the diagnosis. Other finding of note was fibromuscular dysplasia of ostial right main coronary artery causing a significant luminal narrowing.

30866750|t|Endovascular Treatment of Concomitant Carotid Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Atherosclerotic Disease After Failed Open Surgical Treatment.
30866750|a|We describe a case of concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) disease in a symptomatic patient. Sixty-eight-year-old female presented for evaluation of a transient ischemic attack. Imaging revealed severe proximal &gt;80% ICA stenosis with severe FMD to mid and distal ICA. Planned hybrid approach with left carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and balloon angioplasty was aborted intraoperatively due to lack of back bleeding. Open gradual rigid dilation was then performed with resumption of back bleeding. Completion angiogram revealed widely patent flow through CEA patch with no residual defects. Patient awoke from operation neurologically intact. At 6-month follow-up, carotid duplex revealed severe recurrent ICA stenosis. Endovascular intervention was performed with balloon dilation to the proximal and mid-ICA with stenting of a moderate 60% ostial common carotid stenosis. She recovered well from procedure with 3-month carotid duplex showing widely patent common carotid stent and ICA with no areas of stenosis. Informed consent has been obtained from the patient for publication of the case report and accompanying images.

30904955|t|Triple and quadruple cervical artery dissections: a systematic review of individual patient data.
30904955|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Simultaneous dissection of three or four cervical arteries rarely occurs. As a result, limited information is available on clinical characteristics, underlying causes, treatment, and outcome of these patients. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of individual patient data on triple and quadruple cervical artery dissection (CeAD). We included all cases for whom, at minimum, data on age, sex and affected cervical arteries were available. RESULTS: Out of 1396 publications identified in the initial search, 52 were included, with data available on 96 patients. Mean age was 42 years and 66% were women. 63% had triple CeAD. The most common manifestations were headache (69%), neck pain (44%), motor deficit (36%), and Horner syndrome (34%). 57% had an ischemic stroke, in the majority of these patients the stroke was confined to the vascular territory of a single artery. 83% were managed medically (antiplatelets or anticoagulants) and 11% underwent endovascular treatment. An underlying disease or triggering event was identified in 71%, most commonly trauma (35%, cervical manipulative therapy in 13%), infection (18%), fibromuscular dysplasia (16%), and hereditary connective tissue disorder (8%). In-hospital mortality was 1%. 80% of patients had a good functional outcome (mRS 0-1) at follow-up. Two recurrences (3%) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Triple or quadruple CeAD mostly affected young women, and underlying disease or triggering event could be identified in more than two-thirds of patients. Less than two-thirds of triple or quadruple CeAD patients suffered ischemic stroke. Most patients were managed medically and the majority had a favorable outcome.

30915028|t|Multimodality Imaging in Carotid Web.
30915028|a|Purpose: Carotid web (CaW) is an underrecognized cause of cryptogenic stroke in young patients. The optimal imaging for CaW is unknown. We aim to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of diverse imaging modalities for the diagnosis of CaW. Methods: Retrospective analysis of institutional neurovascular database was performed to identify patients with multimodal (CT angiogram-CTA, digital subtraction angiogram-DSA, and/or ultrasound-US) imaging diagnosis of CaW or atherosclerosis. Baseline clinical demographics were recorded. Blinded image analysis was performed for each imaging modality by separate readers. Discrepancies were settled by consensus. Two-sided Cohen's Kappa (kappa) coefficient was used to evaluate the inter-rater agreement for the etiological diagnosis between imaging modalities. Results: Thirty patients/60 carotids were evaluated by CTA and 55 carotids were included. Patients with symptomatic CaW (n = 20), compared to individuals with atherosclerosis (n = 10), were younger (49 +- 9 vs. 60 +- 8 years; p &lt; 0.01), more commonly female (75% vs. 30%; p = 0.01), and less frequently presented vascular risk factors: Hypertension (40% vs. 100%; p &lt; 0.01), hyperlipidemia (0% vs. 50%; p &lt; 0.01), diabetes (10% vs. 40%; p = 0.05), and smoking (5% vs. 70%; p &lt; 0.01). High inter-rater correlation strength existed for CTA (n = 55; kappa = 0.88; p &lt; 0.0001) and DSA (n = 28; kappa = 0.86, p &lt; 0.0001) readers for lesion diagnosis while US inter-rater agreement was lower (kappa = 0.553; p = 0.001). Across modalities CTA and DSA shared very high strength of agreement (kappa = 0.92; p &lt; 0.0001), compared to a less pronounced agreement between US and CTA (kappa = 0.553; p = 0.001). The strength of correlation between DSA-CTA was significantly more robust as compared to US-CTA (Z = 3.58; p = 0.0003). Conclusion: CTA and DSA demonstrated comparable and superior performance as compared to US in the diagnosis of CaW.

30932441|t|A rare disease with a rare presentation: hemi-atrophy caused by fibromuscular dysplasia in a 27 month old girl.
30932441|a|We discuss the case of a 27-month-old girl afflicted with fibromuscular dysplasia. She presented with hemiatrophy of left upper and lower limbs, nail dystrophy, ulcers on the tips of her toes, cold and painful limbs, foot drop, and hypertension. The initial appearance started at 2 months of age and other diagnoses such as complex regional pain syndrome, reflex sympathetic syndrome, vasculitis and coagulation disorders had been considered. Angiography revealed that all the arterial branches of the left lower and upper limbs, from brachial to ulnar and radial, and from iliac and femoral to tibialis arteries were affected. Sural nerve biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. In the follow-up visits until 2 years after the patient's discharge she did not develop any new problem and her blood pressure was controlled by enalapril and amlodipine.

30948002|t|Prevalence of Coronary Vasospasm Using Coronary Reactivity Testing in Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.
30948002|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death, particularly in young to middle-aged women. Coronary vasospasm is another condition believed to be associated with SCAD; however, this has only been shown in isolated case reports to date. We sought to examine the association of SCAD and coronary vasospasm by reporting the experience of coronary vasospasm testing in patients with a history of previous SCAD in a large, tertiary referral center. We conducted a single-center retrospective review of patients with history of SCAD confirmed by angiography who received provocative testing using ergonovine in the Cleveland Clinic cardiac catheterization lab from January 1990 to December 2016. Positive vasospasm was defined as: (1) total or subtotal occlusion of at least 1 major coronary artery induced by administration of ergonovine and (2) resolution of said occlusion with the administration of nitrates. Patients with history of strong trauma to the chest and iatrogenic dissection (e.g., catheter-induced) were excluded from the study. We identified 11 patients who satisfied all inclusion criteria. All participants were women and the mean age was 47 years: 73% received screening for fibromuscular dysplasia and of those, 38% were found to have the diagnosis. Only 1 of 11 patients had a positive vasospasm test in the setting of ergonovine administration in the catheterization lab. In conclusion, we found a low prevalence of coronary vasospasm in individuals with confirmed previous SCAD.

30950534|t|Carotid artery fibromuscular dysplasia: Ultrasound and CT imaging.
30950534|a|An asymptomatic 54-year-old Caucasian female was found to have a right carotid bruit located high in the cervical region. Carotid duplex ultrasound revealed carotid intimal disease with increased Doppler flow in the mid-distal right internal carotid artery (RICA) with color Doppler turbulence in the distal RICA. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a typical "string-of-beads" sign in both distal internal carotid artery (ICAs), diagnostic of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). While often not diagnostic, carotid duplex ultrasound may yield clues as to diagnosis of FMD with elevated Doppler velocity in the distal carotid, turbulent distal carotid flow, and possibly a "string-of-beads" sign. An "S-curve" distal ICA is associated with FMD and may warrant further evaluation. Magnetic resonance angiography and CTA appear to be better for diagnosis of carotid FMD. The typical "string-of-beads" may be readily identified. While invasive angiography is considered the "gold standard" for diagnosis of carotid FMD, it is infrequently required. Generally, invasive angiography is performed in symptomatic patients in planning for interventional therapy.

30957570|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a review of complications and management strategies.
30957570|a|INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) accounts for up to 4% of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) on coronary angiography and predominantly affects women (&gt;90%). SCAD most often occurs in patients with few or no conventional cardiovascular risk factors. This condition remains underdiagnosed due to a lack of awareness among health-care providers and misdiagnosis on coronary angiography. Areas covered: In this review, authors aim to summarize contemporary data on the etiology, morbidity and mortality risks, as well as management strategies in order to raise awareness. Expert opinion: The last decade of extensive research revealed that SCAD is not as rare as previously thought and needs to be in the differential diagnosis of all MI patients, especially in young to middle-aged women. Predisposing factors, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, and potential triggers like physical or emotional stresses, are frequently linked. Coronary angiography is the first-line diagnostic tool and should be performed meticulously because of more fragile vessel architecture to avoid iatrogenic dissections. If angiographic findings are uncertain, the use of intravascular imaging may be required. Conservative therapy is favored over revascularization unless patients have high-risk features. Recurrent cardiovascular events post-SCAD are frequent, and patients should be closely monitored after a SCAD event.

30982812|t|A rare and overlooked mechanical complication of partial nephrectomy: Accelerated hypertension due to renal artery stenosis.
30982812|a|Secondary hypertension accounts for 5% to 10% of all hypertensive cases, and renal artery stenosis is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension. Although atherosclerotic vascular disease and fibromuscular dysplasia are the leading causes of renal artery stenosis, there are other, rare etiologies, such as vasculitis and trauma. A partial nephrectomy is the standard of care treatment option for early stage renal carcinoma patients. Traumatic renal artery stenosis can occur during this surgical intervention, though it is a very rare adverse event, and only a few case reports have been reported in the literature. This report is the description of successful percutaneous treatment of accelerated hypertension secondary to traumatic renal artery stenosis after a partial nephrectomy.

30983905|t|Carotid Web Stenting.
30983905|a|Background: Carotid webs are luminal, shelf-like protrusions at the carotid bulb. Considered to be a variant of fibromuscular dysplasia, carotid webs have been observed principally in African American females. The association between carotid webs and recurrent ischemic strokes continues to be established as patients without traditional stroke risk factors are found to have carotid webs as the only possible cause of symptomatic deficits. The majority of patients undergo endarterectomy; few stent placements are reported. We present the case of an African American female who underwent stent placement for treatment and secondary prevention of stroke attributed to a carotid web. Case Report: A 33-year-old African American female presented with acute onset left hemiparesis and left facial droop. Alteplase was administered; multiphase head and neck computed tomography angiography revealed an occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with a web at the carotid bulb. Aspiration catheter thrombectomy achieved a Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score of 3. She was placed on 2 antiplatelet agents, and 3 weeks later she underwent stent placement. Follow-up digital subtraction angiography at 3 months showed obliteration of the right carotid artery web and satisfactory integration of the stent into the vessel wall. She was reassessed at 1 year and reported no neurologic symptoms. Conclusion: Although carotid webs are most commonly treated with endarterectomy, they may be amenable to stent therapy with favorable clinical outcomes as shown with this patient.

31020224|t|Challenges in diagnosing and treating a patient with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia: case report.
31020224|a|Background: We present a patient with history of sinus venous thrombosis and hypertension during the last year. Her blood pressure was not controlled despite drugs, diet, and exercise. She denied symptoms. She does not smoke nor drink alcohol. Her body mass index was 20 kg/m2, NYHA Class I/IV. Case summary: A 40-year-old Latin-American female patient, concerned because despite taking verapamil 160 mg/day, losartan 100 mg/day, and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg/day her diastolic blood pressure was over 100 mmHg. Routine serum and urine lab tests and a transthoracic echocardiogram were done and were normal. The treatment was increased over the next consultations but without control of her blood pressure. She developed resistant hypertension, and she was taking four antihypertensive drugs and two diuretics. A first renal artery Doppler was normal. Because of a high clinical suspicion a renal angio-CT was performed showing bilateral fibromuscular dysplasia. The patient underwent a renal artery angioplasty with balloon with excellent results and better control of her blood pressure after the procedure. Over the next month, her doctors were able to decrease her treatment to two drugs at intermediate doses. Currently, she is doing well and asymptomatic. Discussion: Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) could be a challenging disease to be diagnosed. Patients with this condition may suffer from symptomatic and resistant hypertension. Many patients do not have abnormalities on their physical exam or in the routine lab tests. Treatment includes renal artery angioplasty if patient is symptomatic and blood pressure is resistant.

31020244|t|Multivessel spontaneous coronary artery dissection involving the left main coronary artery: a case report.
31020244|a|Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an infrequent and often misdiagnosis of a non-atherosclerotic cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is an important cause of ACS in young women, responsible for up to 25% of all cases in women &lt;50 years of age without cardiovascular risk factors. Clinical presentation ranges from ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. The treatment of patients with SCAD is a challenge and the ideal management strategy has yet to be determined. Case summary: A 42-year-old woman without family history of cardiac disease and neither traditional atherosclerotic risk factors presented to our centre with an anterior acute ST-segment-elevation MI secondary to multiple spontaneous dissections of the left main, anterior descending, and ramus intermedius coronary arteries. Stenting was performed in the left anterior descending coronary artery and left main coronary artery to resolve its occlusion. Fibromuscular dysplasia was confirmed via computed tomography angiography. Discussion: More cases are now being identified of SCAD due to increased clinical index of suspicion, earlier use of invasive angiography, and intracoronary imaging in patients presenting with acute chest pain. Despite this, the absence of previous cardiovascular risk factors and the ignorance of this pathology delay the start of an adequate medical treatment and the performance of a cardiac catheterization. Prognostic data are limited, partly because of its underdiagnosis and lack of prospective studies, so its knowledge is necessary to improve the prognosis of these patients.

31038477|t|Association of intrarenal blood flow with renal function and target organ damage in hypertensive patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: the ARCADIA-POL study.
31038477|a|INTRODUCTION Data on the assessment of intrarenal blood flow parameters in patients with renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are scarce. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to evaluate intrarenal blood flow parameters in patients with FMD and significant or nonsignificant renal artery stenosis (RAS). PATIENTS AND METHODS We evaluated intrarenal blood flow parameters by Doppler ultrasonography in 153 patients with renal FMD enrolled in the ARCADIA-POL study: 32 and 121 patients with and without significant RAS, respectively, compared with 60 matched patients with essential hypertension and 60 healthy controls. RESULTS Patients with FMD and significant RAS had a lower renal resistive index (RRI) compared with patients with FMD without significant RAS, patients with essential hypertension, and normotensive controls (mean [SD], 0.51 [0.08] vs 0.60 [0.07], 0.62 [0.06], and 0.61 [0.06], respectively; P &lt;0.001). In patients with nonsignificant RAS, RRI correlated significantly with carotid intima-media thickness, 24-hour diastolic blood pressure, 24-hour pulse pressure, left ventricular diastolic function, known duration time of hypertension, and age. In patients with significant RAS, there was a significant correlation between RRI and known duration time of hypertension, left ventricular diastolic function, and age. In a separate, "per-kidney" analysis, renal arteries with FMD and significant RAS were characterized by lower RRI values, higher maximal blood flow velocity, higher renal aortic ratio, and longer acceleration time compared with renal arteries with FMD and nonsignificant RAS as well as renal arteries without FMD. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to atherosclerotic RAS, intrarenal blood flow in patients with FMD and RAS is preserved, confirming that renal vasculature is relatively intact in these patients.

31084345|t|Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of Patients With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.
31084345|a|Background The goal of this study is to report the characteristics and long-term clinical outcomes of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and to identify factors associated with recurrent SCAD . Methods and Results This is a retrospective cohort study that included patients who underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of acute myocardial infarction between 2006 and 2016. Among 26 598 patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, 208 (0.78%) were diagnosed with SCAD . Patients with SCAD were younger (49.0+-11.6 versus 65.6+-12.2 years) and more likely to be women (88.9% versus 31.6%). Atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and diabetes mellitus, were less prevalent. Median follow-up was 4.7 years. Mortality was lower in patients with SCAD (1-year mortality: 2.4% versus 8.8%; P&lt;0.001). After using propensity score matching to control for differences in age, sex, and comorbidities, the difference in mortality was no longer present, suggesting that lower mortality in patients with SCAD is attributed primarily to their baseline characteristics. Recurrent SCAD occurred in 22 patients (10.6%). Multivariate Cox regression modeling showed concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (hazard ratio, 5.1; 95% CI , 1.6-15.8; P=0.005) and migraine headaches (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% CI , 1.4-8.4; P=0.008) to be associated with increased risk of recurrent SCAD . Conclusions Among patients with acute myocardial infarction, patients with SCAD have a lower risk of mortality, which is attributed primarily to their younger age, female sex, and low prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors. Risk of recurrent SCAD persists years after the initial presentation. Patients with fibromuscular dysplasia and migraine are at higher risk for recurrent SCAD .

31129106|t|A Unique Recurrent Stroke Case due to Bilateral Vertebral Artery Dissection with Familial Hirschsprung Disease.
31129106|a|Vertebral artery (VA) dissection is one major cause of brain infarction in young and middle-aged adults. Risk factors for VA dissection are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, trauma, and genetic factors. A 32-year-old man with familial Hirschsprung disease at the age of 2 presented cerebellar ischemic stroke due to bilateral VA dissections. A stroke recurred within 17 days despite oral dual antiplatelet therapy. Bilateral VA dissections and recurrent dissections are related to genetic mutations associated with connective tissue diseases. A part of familial Hirschsprung disease has genetic factors in common with cerebrovascular disease. There may be a common genetic background between his VA dissection and Hirschsprung disease.

31149323|t|Distinct plasma proteomic changes in male and female African American stroke patients.
31149323|a|BACKGROUND: Stroke occurs more often and results in more severe brain injury in African Americans than in Caucasians. The former also exhibit different responses to thrombolytic therapy than the latter do. There is an imminent need for stroke biomarkers for African Americans, who have been underrepresented in biomarker research for stroke diagnosis and prognosis. Proteomics offers sources for protein biomarkers that are not available by other Omics approaches. In this pilot study, plasma proteomes of African American stroke patients were analyzed and compared to that of hypertensive, non-stroke controls. METHODS: Plasma samples were prepared from whole blood specimens that were collected from stroke patients admitted to Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, and their age- and sex-matched, hypertensive controls from the outpatient clinic. Samples were pooled according to patient groups and sex. Plasma proteins were analyzed with quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified and quantified proteins were compared between stroke and control patients of each sex. Proteins that showed changes in abundances in stroke patients were further analyzed with the assistance of bioinformatics tools for their known biological functions or potential implications in stroke. RESULTS: A total of 128 annotated proteins were identified. Results of bioinformatic analysis of plasma proteins whose levels were increased in stroke patients showed, as expected, their association with blood coagulation and inflammation processes. Interestingly, a number of proteins showed different or even opposing changes in male and female stroke patients, notably those involved in IL-4 and IL-6 signaling, complement activation, and blood coagulation disorders. For a few proteins that were increased in female but unchanged or decreased in male stroke patients, an association with fibromuscular dysplasia was recognized. CONCLUSION: Plasma proteins that differ in quantities between stroke patients and controls were readily detected using a simple proteomic approach. Sex-dependent changes and changes that have not been reported for African American stroke patients offer potentially novel biomarkers for stroke in this underserved population.

31192015|t|Case Report of an Acute Myocardial Infarction as a Result of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in a Patient with Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
31192015|a|Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an underdiagnosed and rare cause of myocardial infarction (MI). SCAD is defined as the separation of the coronary artery wall by hemorrhage with or without intimal tear. It causes acute coronary syndrome in 1.7% to 4% of cases. Case Summary: We report a case of a patient with acute MI caused by SCAD with marked progression of dissection within 4 days and spontaneous healing in 2 months. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) of the arteries is an associated condition of SCAD that was found in our patient. Conclusion: In young women admitted to the clinic with signs of acute myocardial infarction, SCAD should be suspected. FMD as an associated condition that should be ruled out in every SCAD patient. Conservative treatment of SCAD is the most preferable strategy.

31200039|t|The Association of Intracranial Aneurysms in Women with Renal Artery Aneurysms.
31200039|a|BACKGROUND: Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) may reflect a systemic dysplastic arteriopathy, independent of a recognized connective tissue disease. It is hypothesized that RAAs are associated with an increased risk of intracranial aneurysms (IcAs). The objective of this study was to better define the association of IcAs in women with RAAs. METHODS: Women aged 20 to 60 years who presented with RAAs at the University of Michigan from 2001 to 2016 were included in the study. Their clinical status and radiologic images were retrospectively reviewed, with particular attention directed to the prevalence of IcAs. Phenotypic characteristics predictive of associated cerebrovascular lesions were assessed using various statistical analyses, including binomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 83 women with RAAs, the average age at the time of RAA detection was 45.3 +- 9.9 years (range, 20-60 years). Hypertension affected 56 (67.5%) patients and poorly controlled hypertension prompted imaging for suspected renal arterial disease in 12 (14.5%) patients. Multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia occurred in 12 (14.8%) of patients, and unifocal stenosis affected 7 (8.4%) patients. Imaging of the intracranial vasculature (n = 31) documented 12 aneurysms in 9 women, with the cavernous internal carotid artery being the most commonly affected artery. Among the study's patients, 20 (24.1%) had an "at-risk disorder for IcA formation," although the frequency of relevant "at-risk disorders" in those with and without IcAs was not statistically different (P = 0.21). Rupture risk defined by PHASES score was less than 1% for 10 IcAs, but 2 IcAs carried a 2.4% and 7.2% rupture risk, respectively, over a 5-year time period. Surgical management was pursued in 6 (50%) of the study's IcAs. CONCLUSIONS: Coexisting RAAs and IcAs may reflect a systemic arteriopathy. IcAs appear to occur with greater frequency in women with RAAs than the general population. This observation warrants prospective investigation as to the clinical appropriateness and relevance of cerebrovascular imaging in women with RAAs. Furthermore, this study's findings prompt further investigation of the underlying pathogenesis of what appears to be a broader and more complex arterial disease than previously recognized.

31200053|t|Nonatherosclerotic Abdominal Vasculopathies.
31200053|a|BACKGROUND: Nonatherosclerotic abdominal arterial vasculopathies (NAVs), including mesenteric or renal artery dissection, aneurysm, stenosis, and vasculitis, are rare but have great clinical significance. Patients may present emergently with life-threatening complications such as arterial rupture and hemorrhagic shock. Herein, we present our center's experience with NAVs and provide extensive literature review to close the gap in the scarce, related literature. METHODS: From a single-center retrospective data analysis, we identified and characterized subjects (aged 18-60 years) who presented with NAV between January 2000 and December 2015. Of the 1416 charts reviewed, 118 met inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The average age of patients with NAV was 47.0 +- 9.9 years, mostly affecting women (64%). Primary diagnoses included fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) (25.4%), isolated aneurysms (24.6%), and median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) (15.3%). Less common diagnoses were localized vasculitis of the gastrointestinal tract (LVGT) (7.6%), isolated dissection (5.1%), microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (5.1%), trauma (4.2%), segmental arterial mediolysis (4.2%), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (2.5%), Takayasu's arteritis (2.5%), polyarteritis nodosa (1.7%), idiopathic abdominal aortitis (0.8%), and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (0.8%). Females constituted 90% of patients with FMD, 77.8% with MALS, 77.8% with isolated aneurysms, 66.7% with Takayasu arteritis, and 55.6% with LVGT. Prevalent comorbidities included tobacco use (43.6%) and hypertension (52.1%). Coil embolization was used in 14.4%, anticoagulation in 11.9%, angioplasty/stenting in 11.9%, open resection/surgical revascularization in 10.2%, and prednisone in 10.2% of the cases. Conservative management was pursued in 33.1% of the patients. A high degree of symptom relief was shown in 91.7%. CONCLUSIONS: NAV are rare and can be caused by different etiologies that primarily affect females. Hypertension and tobacco use were prevalent. Various imaging strategies revealed aneurysms, stenosis, dissection, and/or thrombosis affecting renal and celiac arteries. Most patients improved with conservative, medical, endovascular, or surgical approach. More research is needed to standardize management approach to patients with NAV.

31232618|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: etiology and recurrence.
31232618|a|Introduction: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly appreciated cause of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and sudden cardiac death most often affecting young to middle-aged women with few conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Areas covered: A literature search was performed using MedLine, PubMed, and Google Scholar (dating to 04/30/2019). Authors review the key clinical features of SCAD and highlight what is known regarding its pathophysiology and associated factors. The relationship between SCAD and other systemic vasculopathies, notably fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is also discussed. Authors also mention the management of acute SCAD along with considerations for long term follow-up such as chest pain syndrome, extracoronary vasculopathy screening, and recurrent SCAD. Expert opinion: Our understanding regarding the association of SCAD and other arteriopathies such as FMD is anticipated to grow. In addition, progress is likely to be made in our efforts to predict recurrent SCAD risk and define potential preventative strategies, possibly through the incorporation of adjunctive imaging.

31235669|t|[Reconsideration of Carotid Web and the Therapeutic Strategy].
31235669|a|The term "carotid web" was first used in 1973 and is considered a rare form of fibromuscular dysplasia(FMD). A carotid web was reported to produce thrombus formation and cause of ischemic events. However, it is rarely reported because of its low incidence. As for the diagnosis, noninvasive routine radiological modalities such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance angiography may have very low sensitivity due to the subtle nature of the entity. Therefore, these types of lesions may be often underdiagnosed. We describe three cases that presented with minor and recurrent major ischemic strokes resistant to medical management. All 3 cases had a good course with no recurrence after carotid endarterectomy. On pathological examination, all specimens revealed mild atherosclerotic change, although FMD was known to be a non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic angiopathy. Early detection of a carotid web is highly important. Three-dimensional CT angiography(3D-CTA)maximum intensity projection(MIP)imaging seems to be a reliable noninvasive technique, although catheter angiography is considered as the gold standard. The cases with carotid web have characteristics such as more recurrent ischemic stroke and resistance to medical management. Surgical treatment should be considered if medical management in unsuccessful. Moreover, even if asymptomatic, it might also be considered for cases with a growing web or with blood stasis behind the web.

31248449|t|Kissing stent management of stenosis of two branches of left renal artery bifurcation: a case report.
31248449|a|BACKGROUND: Secondary hypertension accounts for 5% of all cases of hypertension. Renal artery stenosis is one of the common causes of secondary hypertension. Atherosclerosis and fibromuscular dysplasia are the commonest types of stenosis associated with renal vascular hypertension, with the former accounting for 70-80% of all cases and the latter accounting for 10% of the incidence. The greatest incidence atherosclerosis is in men over the age of 40 years, mostly affecting the proximal part of the renal arteries, whereas fibromuscular dysplasia affects women ranging in age from 30 to 50 years. Currently, possible treatments are medical treatment using blood pressure-lowering drugs, balloon angioplasty with or without stent insertion, and surgery to reconstruct the artery. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 46-year-old Asian woman with stenosis of two branches of renal artery bifurcation treated by percutaneous balloon dilatation and stenting of both branches after referral to our department for a renal angiogram following 8 months of uncontrolled hypertension despite receiving medications. Initially, the patient presented with severe headache and fatigue. She was a known nonsmoker, was not diabetic, and had no history of diabetes in her family. She had no history of atherosclerosis. Apart from high blood pressure, the result of her physical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory investigations revealed normal serum cholesterol, lipid profile, and serum creatinine. She had been attending a hypertension clinic and receiving antihypertensive drugs for the past 8 months on a regular basis under close observation. Despite this treatment and care, her blood pressure remained high at 175/110 mmHg, which the attending doctor concluded to be uncontrolled blood pressure. Initial imaging indicated left renal artery stenosis, and the patient was referred to our department. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite receiving medications, renal Doppler ultrasound should be included in the diagnostic workup for secondary hypertension. Once renal artery stenosis is suspected, renal angiography is highly recommended because the technique is able to accurately diagnose stenosis in the branch arteries, unlike computed tomographic angiography and magnetic resonance angiography. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty is the treatment of choice for renal artery stenosis in patients with renovascular hypertension or renal dysfunction.

31270375|t|Hemorrhagic stroke and renovascular hypertension with Grange syndrome arising from a novel pathogenic variant in YY1AP1.
31270375|a|Pediatric hypertension can cause hypertensive emergencies, including hemorrhagic stroke, contributing to rare but serious childhood morbidity and mortality. Renovascular hypertension (RVH) is one of the major causes of secondary hypertension in children. Grange syndrome (MIM#602531) is a rare disease characterized by multiple stenosis or occlusion of the renal, abdominal, coronary, and cerebral arteries, which can cause phenotypes of RVH and fibromuscular dysplasia (MIM#135580). We report the case of a 7-year-old girl with Grange syndrome who showed RVH and multiple seizure episodes. At 1 year of age, she experienced seizures and sequential hemiparesis caused by a left thalamic hemorrhage without cerebral vascular anomalies. Chronic hypertension was observed, and abdominal computed tomography angiography showed characteristic bilateral renal artery stenosis. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous pathogenic variant in the YY1AP1 gene (NM_001198903.1: c.1169del: p.Lys390Argfs*12). Biallelic YY1AP1 mutations are known to cause Grange syndrome. Unlike previously reported patients, our patient presented with intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke without anomalous brain artery or bone fragility. The phenotype in our patient may help better understand this ultra-rare syndrome. Grange syndrome should be considered in patients presenting with childhood-onset hypertension and/or hemorrhagic stroke for early clinical intervention.

31275482|t|Hypereosinophilia and Multisite Vasculopathy of Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Case Report.
31275482|a|The impact of blood disorders on fibromuscular dysplasia is unknown, and cardiovascular surgery results are also unclear. Furthermore, there are only a few case reports about the association between fibromuscular dysplasia and blood disorders. We report a case of a coronary bypass surgery and an aortic root replacement for a patient who is hypereosinophilic with multisite vasculopathy of fibromuscular dysplasia, including that of the coronary artery and saphenous vein, which was diagnosed by a histopathologic examination after an autopsy was performed 5 months after surgery. The outcome of cardiovascular surgery can be unfavorable for fibromuscular dysplasia. Blood disorders may also have an impact on the outcome.

31275813|t|Screening of extra-coronary arteriopathy with magnetic resonance angiography in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection: a single-centre experience.
31275813|a|Background: Current consensus recommends extended vascular investigation in patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). We here report our experience with the use of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) for screening extra-coronary arteriopathy in patients presenting with SCAD. Methods: Patients presenting with SCAD in a Spanish centre underwent prospective contrast-enhanced MRA to assess the cephalic and abdominopelvic arterial territories. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was diagnosed following European consensus criteria. Other vascular abnormalities were recorded separately. Two vascular radiologists supervised the acquisitions and independently analysed the results for all cases. Results: Forty patients with SCAD [mean age 50.9+-8.6 years, 90% (n=36) women] were included in the study, 12 patients declined to participate and 5 were excluded (metallic implanted devices). All enrolled patients underwent the screening protocol without complications. MRA demonstrated at least one extra-coronary vascular abnormality in 16 patients (40%): 5 (12.5%) were diagnosed with FMD, 6 (15%) showed arterial tortuosity, 3 (7.5%) had non-FMD focal stenoses, and 2 (5%) were found to have small aneurysms at the celiac trunk and splenic artery. No intracranial aneurysms were detected. At a mean follow-up of 4+-3 years from the index episode, two cases experienced SCAD recurrences, one in a patient with FMD and the other one in a patient with arterial tortuosity. No deaths or strokes occurred. Conclusions: Systematic extended vascular study with MRA was feasible and demonstrated associated extra-coronary arteriopathy in a substantial proportion of patients presenting with SCAD; however, none required additional intervention or led to vascular events. MRA, being a radiation-free modality, may be the preferred method for screening extracoronary arteriopathy in SCAD, a condition primarily affecting young and middle-age women sensitive to the risks of radiation.

31320943|t|A case of spontaneous coronary artery dissection with early de novo recurrence.
31320943|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare cause of acute coronary syndrome compared with atherosclerotic plaque rupture and predominantly occurs in young women. SCAD is associated with various conditions, such as emotional stress, pregnancy, hormonal therapy, collagen diseases, fibromuscular dysplasia, or vasospasm. Long-term cardiovascular events are common including the recurrence of SCAD. We report a case of SCAD with de novo recurrence at only 4 days after the first attack. &lt;Learning objectives: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a relatively rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with atherosclerotic plaque rupture, but if young to middle-aged women develop ACS, a high suspicion of SCAD is warranted. Recurrence of SCAD is common with 4- to 10-year follow-up. However, SCAD recurred early as in our case.&gt;.

31327836|t|Rare Mesenteric Arterial Diseases: A Case Report of Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Segmental Arterial Mediolysis and Literature Review.
31327836|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) are noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic arterial diseases that cause aneurysm, occlusion, and thromboses. These diseases are rarely seen in mesenteric arterial lesions; however, as they can be lethal if appropriate management is not provided, the accumulation of clinical information from cases is essential. We herein report the cases of a 57-year-old man diagnosed with FMD and a 63-year-old man diagnosed with SAM. We conclude that an early diagnosis with imaging modalities and clinical information followed by the appropriate treatment improves the prognosis of these arterial diseases.

A total of 32 (0.54%) patients with carotid web were finally diagnosed in 5 943 patients who underwent carotid computerized tomography angiography (CTA) in two hospitals. Only one patient received carotid endarterectomy that pathological findings were fibrous tissue hyperplasia of vascular wall with mucinous degeneration. Stent implantation was administrated in two cases. Among 13 asymptomatic patients, the observational follow-up period was (20.9+-12.4) months without strokes. Carotid web is a rare aberration. Asymptomatic patients with carotid web are usually silent. Large sized cohort and long-term follow-up are further needed.

31394546|t|Renal Artery Dissection in a Young Woman: Diagnoses Beyond Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
31394546|a|A 31-year-old woman presented at the emergency room after experiencing colic pain in the right iliac fossa for 5 days. She had previously consulted another center, where deterioration of renal function had been identified and abdominal computed tomography (CT) angiography had shown a dissection of the right renal artery, with areas suggestive of infarction in the right kidney, as well as an aneurysm in the left renal artery and a smaller left kidney. The patient had no relevant family or personal history except posttraumatic carotid-cavernous fistula in 2014, which had been treated with embolization. In our hospital, the patient was hypertensive and acute renal failure was confirmed, accompanied by an increase in lactate dehydrogenase and isomorphic microhematuria. After a new CT Scan, in addition to the lesions described in the renal arteries, another aneurysm in the splenic artery and an aneurysm of the right femoral artery were identified. Antihypertensive treatment was initiated with calcium antagonists and anticoagulation. Subsequent renal arteriography confirmed the dissection of the right renal artery, which could not be repaired, and a coated stent was placed in the left renal artery to exclude the aneurysm. The splenic artery lesion was treated 2 months later. The etiological diagnosis in this young woman was challenging. The presence of visceral aneurysms suggested a differential diagnosis comprising fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and collagenopathies. Using a multidisciplinary approach and directed anamnesis, the presence of frequent sprains, joint hypermobility, and skin fragility was confirmed. Blood immunology and CT angiography including the thoracic and cervical territories were normal. Echocardiography revealed tricuspid insufficiency. All these data suggested the presence of a collagen-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vascular form). The diagnosis was confirmed by the genetic study, which showed a pathogenic mutation in the COL3A1 gene. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic with recovered renal function following treatment with a beta-blocker and antiplatelet therapy.

31414617|t|Subclinical involvement of common carotid arteries in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia - a case-control study.
31414617|a|Background: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) primarily involves medium-sized arteries, though the entire spectrum of vascular involvement is not fully understood. We hypothesized that larger arteries may also be affected, albeit sub-clinically. Patients and methods: We measured the cross-sectional diameter of the thoracic aorta, abdominal aorta, common iliac arteries (CIA) and common carotid arteries (CCA) in FMD subjects and compared them to matched controls. We retrospectively analyzed records of FMD subjects (n = 74) and of age- and sex- matched controls (n = 74) that underwent computed tomography of the neck, chest or abdomen. Cross-sectional diameters of the thoracic and abdominal aorta, CIA and CCA were measured in a standardized manner by two trained physicians. Results: The FMD group had a significantly greater diameter of the CIA and CCA bilaterally. The measurements (mm) in FMD and control groups were as follows: Right CIA: 10.85 + 1.75 vs. 10.23 + 1.36, p = 0.04, left CIA: 11.01 + 1.93 vs. 10.15 + 1.38, p = 0.007, right CCA: 7.70 + 0.81 vs. 6.80 + 1.10, p &lt; 0.001 and left CCA: 7.70 + 1.10 vs. 6.80 + 1.0, p &lt; 0.001). There was no difference in the diameter between the two groups in the ascending aorta, descending and the abdominal aorta. After adjusting for baseline differences, common carotid arteries (but not common iliac) were significantly larger in FMD group compared with controls. Conclusions: There is sub-clinical involvement of the common carotid arteries in patients with FMD and this manifests as a greater diameter of these arteries compared to age and sex matched controls.

31449625|t|Optical coherence tomography in varying aetiologies of renal artery stenosis: a case series.
31449625|a|BACKGROUND: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a common cause of secondary hypertension. The most common aetiology is atherosclerosis; however, other causes like fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and Takayasu arteritis (TA) are also frequently encountered. The lesion characteristics and its response to percutaneous intervention depend upon the aetiology of RAS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an excellent imaging modality to analyse coronary lesions during percutaneous coronary interventions. The data regarding the utility of OCT in renal artery imaging is limited, consisting of a few case reports. CASE SUMMARY: We hereby report four cases of RAS, each of different aetiology (atherosclerotic, FMD, post-transplant, and TA), who underwent OCT imaging of the renal artery along with percutaneous renal angioplasty. DISCUSSION: The advantages of OCT imaging include demonstration of the arterial wall, pathological features of the disease, and to guide percutaneous interventions. The major limitation of OCT is its lower imaging depth, which may render imaging of large vessels difficult.

Most PAAs are caused by chronic inflammation secondary to atherosclerotic disease; other non-degenerative causes of PAAs include arterial trauma, infection, Behcet's disease, medial fibromuscular dysplasia, or popliteal artery entrapment. Few case reports have been published on idiopathic congenital PAAs. We report a case of a 26-year-old man who presented with progressive claudication and subsequent acute limb ischemia due to the thrombosis of a large idiopathic PAA. Our case demonstrates that the differential diagnosis of young adult or pediatric patients presenting with signs of acute limb ischemia or claudication should include a symptomatic PAA.

31451980|t|Hypertension in Premenopausal and Postmenopausal Women.
31451980|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine available clinical data on the differences between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with hypertension (HTN). Clinical conditions related to HTN and reproductive status differ in younger women compared with older women. Due to recent changes in the definition of HTN, the prevalence of HTN has increased significantly in all women. Rising rates of obesity among women of all ages increase the risk for HTN. RECENT FINDINGS: Among younger women, long-term vascular consequences of preeclampsia, the under-reported prevalence of fibromuscular dysplasia, and widespread use of oral contraceptive pills in women with contraindications confer unique risks for HTN-related cardiovascular risk. For older women, insights on vascular aging and hormonal changes with menopause are shown to be gender-specific causal factors for HTN. Assessment of risk factors unique to premenopausal and postmenopausal women can facilitate the management of HTN and improve long-term outcomes. Further studies in women are needed to accurately stratify women risk based on these risk factors.

31454065|t|Prevalence and characteristics of renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia in hypertensive women below 50 years old.
31454065|a|BACKGROUND: Renal fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is typically diagnosed in young hypertensive women. The 2014 European FMD Consensus recommended screening in all hypertensive women &lt;30 yo. However, the prevalence of renal FMD in young/middle-aged hypertensive women remains unclear. The aim of this work was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of renal FMD in hypertensive women &lt;=50 yo. METHODS: We retrospectively included all consecutive women aged &lt;=50 years referred to our Hypertension Unit from 2014 to 2017 and collected standardized information on patient characteristics and screening modalities. RESULTS: Of 1083 incident hypertensive patients, 157 patients fitted with inclusion criteria. The prevalence of renal FMD varied between 3.2% in the whole sample and 7.5% in patients explored by CTA and/or MRA (n = 67). In the subgroup of patients &lt;=30 yo (n = 32), the corresponding figures were 3.1% and 5.6%. The yearly prevalence of FMD tended to increase over time, in parallel with increased use of CTA/MRA as a first-line imaging modality. Out of 5 patients with renal FMD, 2 were revascularized and 1 had extra-renal FMD. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of renal FMD in young/middle-aged hypertensive women is probably one order of magnitude higher than previously assumed, in the range of 3%-8%, depending on imaging modalities. While the diagnosis of FMD does not influence short-term management in all patients, it may allow close monitoring and prevention of complications of the disease over time. This analysis provides the rationale for a prospective, multicentre study aiming at determining the cost-effectiveness of systematic screening for renal FMD.

31482436|t|Role of Invasive and Non-invasive Imaging Tools in the Diagnosis and Optimal Treatment of Patients with Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.
31482436|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a serious non-atherosclerotic disease, most frequently presenting as an acute coronary syndrome and affecting female patients. Considering that diagnosis of SCAD is often elusive, and its interventional treatment is associated to a higher rate of complications than obstructive atherosclerotic disease, we aim to review all the imaging tools currently available for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: The developments in both invasive and non-invasive imaging alternatives to coronary angiography, such as intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and computed coronary angiography, have largely contributed to appraise the epidemiology of SCAD, understand its causative pathophysiological mechanisms, and improve our ability to confirm doubtful cases of SCAD. Intracoronary imaging is also a valuable in deciding the best therapeutic approach and in guiding interventions in those patients requiring percutaneous treatment. Furthermore, non-invasive imaging is a key tool in ruling out significant extracoronary vascular abnormalities which frequently occur in patients with underlying conditions like fibromuscular dysplasia who develop SCAD. Main imaging tools employed in SCAD cases could have advantages and drawbacks. Focusing on different types of SCAD, operators should be able to choose the best imaging technique for diagnosis, management, and follow-up.

31497143|t|Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm - Challenges in the Management: A Case Report and Review Literature.
31497143|a|Extracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms (EICA) are rare. Incidence is &lt;1% of all an arterial aneurysm. This aneurysm being rare but is important because it is associated with a high risk of neurological thromboembolic events, cranial nerve compression, and rupture. The causes of the EICA are congenital, trauma leading to the pseudoaneurysm, atherosclerosis, infections, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Here, we describe a case report of a 69-year-old female with progressive enlargement of the right neck mass accompanied by dyspnea on exertion. The patient had been diagnosed as right EICA and underwent the endovascular procedure as parent vessel occlusion 4 years ago. There was still enlargement of the size of the right neck mass and was causing troublesome to the patient. We performed selective embolization of the various feeders to the mass, but after this also, it was still enlarging. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the computed tomography scan showed fusiform dilatation of the right proximal EICA. We made the diagnosis of the thrombosed EICA and hence we planned to undergo surgical management. We performed removal of the intraluminal thrombus and ligation of the EICA. The size of the swelling decreased significantly.

31515184|t|"Basilar Web" Causing Basilar Branch Infarction.
31515184|a|We present a young patient with no vascular risk factors with a basilar branch infarction secondary to a shelf-like filling defect of the basilar artery. This defect was present and unchanged on repeat imaging and determined to be most consistent with a basilar web. Similar to carotid webs, a basilar web is believed to be an area of focal intimal fibroplasia that increases the risk of brainstem infarction. Focal fibroplasia of the posterior circulation should be considered when evaluating young adults with posterior circulation strokes of otherwise undetermined cause.

31526531|t|Successful Kidney Transplantation Using a Deceased Donor Graft With Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
31526531|a|All over the world there is serious concern about the shortage of organs available for transplantation. In an effort to address this, transplantation with grafts, which was previously considered a contraindication, are now performed. In some cases, this practice has contributed to increasing the organ pool. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is the second-most-common cause of renovascular hypertension and is observed in 2%-6.6% of potential live kidney donors. Kidney with FMD is generally considered to be a contraindication for renal transplantation because renal artery stenosis may progress after transplantation and cause graft loss. Here, we report on a successful case of kidney transplantation using a graft with FMD of a deceased donor who had multiple aneurysms in the renal artery.

31536471|t|Case 270: Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Associated with Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
31536471|a|HistoryA 54-year-old woman presented with typical chest pain during physical training at the gym. She had a history of hypertension controlled with hydrochlorothiazide, without any other cardiovascular risk factor and with neither personal nor family history of ischemic heart disease. She was postmenopausal and had a long-standing history of migraine headaches without hormonal or drug therapy. The patient had no history of clinically important thoracic trauma or invasive chest interventions. Initial electrocardiography (ECG) showed signs of ongoing anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and emergent coronary angiography with angioplasty and intravascular US were performed. Maximal level of high-sensitive T troponins was 820 ng/L (normal, &lt;13 ng/L), while echocardiography showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction, with no apparent regional wall motion abnormalities. General physical examination findings were unremarkable, excluding ligamentous hyperlaxity and joint instability. C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and angiotensin-converting enzyme blood test results were negative. For further evaluation, arterial phase ECG-synchronized CT angiography from the skull base to the pubis symphysis was performed.

31553499|t|Hemorrhagic Retinopathy and Optic Nerve Sheath Hemorrhage Associated With Fatal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage from a Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysm Due to Segmental Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
31553499|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia is an idiopathic, nonatheromatous, and noninflammatory arterial disease that most commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries. We report a child with subarachnoid and ocular hemorrhage associated with an aneurysm due to fibromuscular dysplasia. Computed tomography following a witnessed collapse revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and severe cerebral edema. An autopsy confirmed the radiographic findings and detected bilateral retinal hemorrhages, optic nerve sheath hemorrhages, and a ruptured saccular aneurysm due to focal fibromuscular dysplasia involving the intracranial right vertebral artery. This case documents a fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage in a child with an intracranial saccular aneurysm caused by fibromuscular dysplasia. The associated retinal hemorrhages are easily detected by postmortem monocular indirect ophthalmoscopy.

31563567|t|Carotid Webs in Cryptogenic Ischemic Strokes: A Matched Case-Control Study.
31563567|a|BACKGROUND: Young individuals with symptomatic carotid webs may be predisposed to ischemic strokes. However, evidence remains scarce. This investigation reports the frequency of carotid webs among patients with cryptogenic strokes compared to a control group. METHODS: Consecutive cryptogenic ischemic strokes and trauma patients were identified. Additional inclusion criteria required age 18-60 years and availability of head/neck computed tomography (CT) angiography. CT angiogram (CTA) neck images were evaluated independently by 2 fellowshiptrained specialists. A carotid web was defined by a shelf-like, linear filling defect in the posterior internal carotid artery bulb. RESULTS: Of 1877 patients presenting with ischemic strokes in 2015-2017, 165 were diagnosed with cryptogenic strokes, 51 of whom met the inclusion criteria of age and CTA availability. Fifty one trauma cases were matched for age and sex. After imaging analysis, 13 carotid webs (25%) were identified in the 51 cryptogenic stroke group versus 0 (0%; P &lt; .001) in trauma subjects. Thirty-nine of the 51 cryptogenic ischemic stroke patients were found with carotid anterior distribution infarcts, of which 9 (23%) were found with ipsilateral carotid webs. There were more proximal large vessel occlusions in the cryptogenic patients with carotid webs, compared to those without (P = .04). All carotid webs led to less than 30% degree of stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid webs were found at a significantly higher frequency in patients with cryptogenic ischemic strokes compared to controls, indicating a potentially thrombogenic nature of these lesions in young patients. Additionally, intracranial large vessel occlusions were more common in patients with symptomatic carotid webs, presenting with ipsilateral strokes.

31567442|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection: update 2019.
31567442|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in women with few or no conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Lack of awareness about this condition among healthcare providers had led to significant underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in this relatively young patient population. RECENT FINDINGS: The current review summarizes the contemporary data on cause, management strategies and outcomes of SCAD. SUMMARY: SCAD is not as rare as previously thought, accounting for up to 4% of all acute coronary syndromes. It is frequently linked with predisposing factors, such as fibromuscular dysplasia or other vasculopathies, and is often triggered by physical or emotional stress. Due to more fragile vessel architecture, coronary angiography as the first-line diagnostic tool should be performed meticulously to avoid iatrogenic dissection. Intravascular imaging may be required if angiographic findings are uncertain. Unless patients have high-risk features such as ongoing ischemia, recurrent chest pains, left main artery dissection, ventricular arrhythmias, or hemodynamic instability, a conservative treatment strategy is favored over revascularization. Close monitoring is essential after a SCAD-event as recurrent cardiovascular events post-SCAD are frequent.

31582039|t|Central Nervous System Vasculopathies.
31582039|a|Various imaging techniques play a role in the diagnosis of CNS vasculopathies, which comprise a heterogeneous group of disorders, including various noninflammatory and inflammatory etiologies. Noninflammatory vasculopathies include entities such as CADASIL, Susac, moyamoya, fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculopathy of connective tissue disorders, and reversible vasoconstriction syndrome. Inflammatory vasculopathies include vasculitides of different vessel sizes, primary angiitis of the CNS, vasculitis of systemic disease, and vasculitis secondary to specific causes. Miscellaneous etiology includes cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which has noninflammatory and inflammatory subtypes. This article discusses important clinical and imaging findings used to distinguish these disorders.

31611120|t|Wilson Disease With Giant Splenic Artery Aneurysms Caused by Fibromuscular Dysplasia During Living Donor Liver Transplantation: A Case Report.
31611120|a|Liver cirrhosis can cause splenic artery aneurysms (SAA) that pose a threat to patients undergoing liver transplantation. However, liver transplantation with multiple visceral artery aneurysms including giant SAA caused by arterial fragility has never been reported. We describe a 36-year-old man with decompensated liver cirrhosis due to Wilson disease that was complicated by giant SAA and multiple aneurysms in the bilateral renal arteries caused by fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The maximal diameter of the triple snowball-shaped SAA was 11 cm. We planned a 2-stage strategy consisting of a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy to treat the SAA and subsequent living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) to address the liver cirrhosis. This strategy was selected to prevent fatal postoperative infectious complications caused by the potential development of pancreatic fistula during simultaneous procedures and to histopathologically diagnose the arterial lesion before LDLT to promote safe hepatic artery reconstruction. However, a postoperative pancreatic fistula did not develop after a splenectomy with distal pancreatectomy, and the pathologic findings of the artery indicated FMD. The patient underwent ABO-identical LDLT with a right lobe graft donated by his brother. Other than postoperative rupture of the aneurysm in the left renal artery requiring emergency interventional radiology, the patient has remained free of any other arterial complications and continues to do well at 2 years after LDLT.

31626173|t|[An analysis of blood flow indicators in pathological kinked internal carotid arteries with their orthostatic and rotational positions].
31626173|a|AIM: To assess the dynamics of blood flow in patients with hemodynamically significant pathological kinked internal carotid arteries (PK ICA) with their orthostatic and rotational positions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six patients, including 35 with PK ICA due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and 51 with PK ICA due to hypertensive heart disease, and 20 healthy people were examined. All patients underwent Doppler ultrasound scanning. All indicators were evaluated in the position of the patient lying on his back and functional stress tests (orthostatic, rotational). RESULTS: The peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, peripheral resistance index did not differ significantly in patients with PK ICA due to FMD and hypertensive heart disease. The increase of blood flow in bends was significantly higher with S-shaped kinking, regardless of the reason for their formation (p&lt;0.05). In orthostatic position, significant changes of hemodynamic parameters in ICA in healthy people did not occur. Moreover, more frequent formation of turbulent blood flows in the group with hypertensive heart disease (78%) and a decrease in LBFV in the standing position were found in patients with PK ICA due to FMD. Rotational position did not alter the hemodynamics in ICA in healthy people and significantly influenced the values of LBFV in patients with PK ICA. CONCLUSION: Changes in hemodynamic parameters in the area of kinking with orthostatic and rotational positions of ICA demonstrate more significant impairments in patients with PK ICA due to hypertensive heart disease compared to patients with FMD. The rotational position of PK ICA is the most informative for identifying turbulent blood flow and an increase in peak systolic velocity in the area of kinking.

31633303|t|Grange syndrome due to homozygous YY1AP1 missense rare variants.
31633303|a|Grange syndrome (OMIM 602531) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by severe early onset vascular occlusive disease and variable penetrance of brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. Grange syndrome is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the YYA1P1 gene. We report on the case of a 53-year old female with novel homozygous missense variants in YYA1P1 (c.1079C&gt;T, p.Pro360Leu), presenting with a history of brachysyndactyly, hypertension, and ischemic stroke. Imaging studies revealed stenosis of the bilateral internal carotid with extensive collateralization of cerebral vessels in a moyamoya-like pattern, along with stenosis in the splenic, common hepatic, celiac, left renal, and superior mesenteric arteries. Functional studies conducted with the patient's dermal fibroblasts suggest that the p.Pro360Leu variant decreases the stability of the YY1AP1 protein. This is the first report of a missense variant associated with Grange syndrome characterized by later onset of vascular disease and a lack of developmental delay and bone fragility.

31655775|t|Renovascular Hypertension.
31655775|a|Renovascular disease (RVD) is a major cause of secondary hypertension. Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is the most common type of RVD followed by fibromuscular dysplasia. It has long been recognized as the prototype of angiotensin-dependent hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying the physiopathology of hypertensive occlusive vascular renal disease are complex and distinction between the different causes of RVD should be made. Recognition of these distinct types of RVD with different degrees of renal occlusive disease is important for management. The greatest challenge is to individualize and implement the best approach for each patient in the setting of widely different comorbidities.

31660461|a|Internal mammary artery aneurysms are rare but serious clinical entities. Rupture results in hemothorax and can be life threatening. Most reported cases are pseudoaneurysms secondary to iatrogenic or traumatic causes. Noniatrogenic, nontraumatic, true internal mammary artery aneurysms have most commonly been associated with vasculitides or connective tissue disorders; rare cases have been deemed idiopathic. We describe a rare case of bilateral internal mammary artery aneurysms-successfully treated with coil embolization-in the setting of heterozygosity for a missense variant of unknown significance in the COL5A1 gene and multifocal fibrodysplastic changes on angiography.

31660487|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the proximal left circumflex artery: a case report.
31660487|a|Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has gained attention as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome and sudden cardiac death (SCD) among women. Management strategies of SCAD differ from those of atherosclerotic disease. There is an elevated risk of complications and suboptimal outcomes in patients with SCAD undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). Case summary: A 48-year-old woman without any traditional cardiovascular risk factors was admitted with severe central chest pain with associated dyspnoea and diaphoresis. The patient had a strong family history of SCD, affecting three female members in their 40s and 50s. Cardiac troponins were elevated. Coronary angiogram showed moderate to severe stenosis of the proximal circumflex coronary artery. Optical coherence tomography confirmed SCAD with sub-intimal haematoma. Despite significant stenosis in the proximal segment of a relatively large artery, a decision was made not to proceed with PCI. The follow-up angiogram demonstrated normal coronaries. Magnetic resonance imaging of renal arteries showed features suggestive of fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the right renal artery. Subsequent genetic counselling and gene testing were unremarkable. Discussion: Conservative management of SCAD is recommended because the large majority of SCAD lesions heal naturally, whereas PCI is associated with increased risk of complications and adverse outcomes. Whether SCAD is associated with the sudden death events in our patient's family remains unclear. It certainly raises concerns as to an inheritable condition. In the absence of post-mortem findings in her family members, we can only speculate about this representing a possible inheritable form of SCAD.

31706452|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection and Its Association With Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Other Vascular Abnormalities.
31706452|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) has recently been associated with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD). We sought to further elucidate the association of FMD with SCAD. We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients with SCAD evaluated at our institution from 2008 to 2019. Baseline characteristics, coronary angiographic data, and screening for FMD were recorded. In patients who completed screening for FMD, variables were compared between patients with FMD and those without. We identified 51 patients with SCAD, all of whom were female, with a mean age of 46.8 years. A quarter of patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and half of those suffered a complication during PCI. 78% of patients underwent complete screening for FMD, of which 63% were diagnosed with multifocal FMD. Vascular abnormalities other than FMD were found in 70% of screened patients. Patients with FMD were older than those without FMD (50.7 vs 42.6 years, p = 0.006). FMD was more frequently associated with type 2 SCAD (84% vs 47%, p = 0.025), tortuous non-SCAD coronaries (96% vs 53%, p = 0.002), and other vascular abnormalities (84% vs 47%, p = 0.03). In conclusion, the majority of patients within the all-female cohort with SCAD were found to have FMD. Other vascular abnormalities were also common. Patients with FMD were older and were more likely to have type 2 SCAD, tortuous non-SCAD coronary arteries, and other vascular abnormalities.

31728831|t|Idiopathic Non-atherosclerotic Carotid Artery Disease.
31728831|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of idiopathic non-atherosclerotic causes of carotid artery disease and its manifestations. RECENT FINDINGS: Four major causes of non-atherosclerotic carotid artery disease including dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, moyamoya disease, and inflammatory large vessel vasculitis are discussed. While there is a dearth of clinical trials involving some of the rarer conditions, recent data from clinical trials supporting antiplatelet over anticoagulation treatment of cervical artery dissection, recent consensus statements on the management of fibromuscular dysplasia, and guideline approaches to diagnosis and treatment of large vessel vasculitis are summarized. Idiopathic non-atherosclerotic causes of carotid artery disease are under appreciated and may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. While less common compared with atherosclerotic disease, non-atherosclerotic disease may affect younger patient populations and result in non-cerebrovascular arterial involvement and systemic organ damage. Therefore, prompt recognition of these disorders is key to their management.

31730516|t|Lower Extremity Skin Ulcer Associated With Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Case Report.
31730516|a|INTRODUCTION: The association between neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) and vasculopathy has been reported frequently, especially cerebral, intestinal, and peripheral vasculopathy. However, cutaneous vasculopathy is infrequent. CASE REPORT: The authors present the case of a 32-year-old man with a painful ulcer on his left thigh of 3 weeks' duration in the same location as a long-time capillary malformation associated with alopecia. The skin biopsy showed signs of perivascular fibromuscular dysplasia with proliferating myofibroblastic cells. The patient had been treated with various therapeutic options, such as topical antibiotics, oral and intralesional corticosteroids, and oral cyclosporine and intravenous prostanoids. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous vasculopathy related to the skin, such as livedo reticularis and ulcers of torpid evolution due to cutaneous vasculopathy are extremely rare. Thus, it is necessary to include skin ulcers as one of the phenotypic manifestations of NF-1.

31732366|t|[Secondary hypertension in women].
31732366|a|The two main non-iatrogenic causes of secondary hypertension in women of childbearing age are primary aldosteronism and renal fibromuscular dysplasia. It is recommended to look for a secondary hypertension in women who remain hypertensive three months after pregnancy, in patients under 40 years of age or in patients with a grade 3 HTN (BP&gt;=180/110mm Hg) (Professional agreement). It is suggested that the initial assessment of a secondary HTN in women is performed by a HTN specialist; it will include an assessment of renin and aldosterone concentrations and an angio-CT of the renal arteries (or angio-MRI if contraindicated) (Grade C - Class 2).

31761304|t|[Percutaneous angioplasty of renal artery stenosis: Short- and long-term results].
31761304|a|INTRODUCTION: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) may be symptomatic. The treatment of these lesions is primarily medical but may sometimes require surgical or endovascular revascularization. RAS angioplasty is well controlled but its results are discussed. The objective of this work was to report the short- and long-term results of the endovascular treatment of renal arteries in our center. METHODS: We report a retrospective study between 2013 and 2018, including patients who received endovascular treatment for severe symptomatic RAS (&gt;=75%). RESULTS: Our population consisted of 17 patients. Mean age was 51.1 years [18-76], sex ratio 2.4. RAS was discovered during work-up for severe renovascular hypertension resistant to medical treatment for 16 patients and rapidly progressive renal failure for one patient. The etiology retained was: atherosclerosis (9 cases), fibromuscular dysplasia (6 cases) and Takayasu's disease (2 cases). The average stenosis rate was 85.9% [75-97%]. We performed simple angioplasty in 47% of the cases and stenting in 53%. The technical success rate was 100%. At 1 month, morbidity-mortality rates were zero. Mean follow-up was 12 months [6-36 months]. Patients with renovascular hypertension experienced a decrease in blood pressure, with discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy in 62.5% of cases and reduction of doses in 37.5% of cases. The permeability rate was 100% at 1 year, 94% at 2 years and 94% at 3 years. One patient had asymptomatic stent thrombosis at the 18th month. The restenosis rate was zero. CONCLUSION: Angioplasty of symptomatic RAS may be indicated as first-line treatment. It is associated with satisfactory results in the short and long terms.

31763504|t|Successful treatment of a ruptured profunda femoris artery aneurysm in association with fibromuscular dysplasia.
31763504|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia is rarely reported in the infra-inguinal arteries. We report a case of an 86-year-old woman who presented with a ruptured profunda femoris artery aneurysm who was found to have angiographic findings of fibromuscular dysplasia in the bilateral deep femoral arteries and bilateral renal arteries. The rupture was treated successfully with a balloon-expandable covered stent.

31767611|t|Large volume haemorrhage following transoral robotic surgery (TORS) as a result of fibromuscular dysplasia: first reported case.
31767611|a|We present a case of a 61-year-old woman who suffered a haemorrhagic complication of an aneurysmal left lingual artery, secondary to fibromuscular dysplasia, following transoral robotic surgery (TORS). She was admitted through the emergency department 3 days after resection of a central base of tongue tumour. She suffered a massive haemorrhage requiring intensive care admission, blood transfusion, intubation, operative and endovascular intervention. The diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia was made at angiography. During attempts to embolise the culprit left lingual artery, the vessel dissected at its origin leading to arrest of bleeding. Repeat angiograms during her admission demonstrated unchanged appearances and ruled out recanalisation of the vessel. She was extubated and remained stable on the ward, discharged home some days later in good health. To our knowledge, this is the first ever reported case of fibromuscular dysplasia affecting the lingual artery leading to aneurysmal dilation and severe haemorrhage following TORS.

31792625|t|Cryptogenic Stroke: Diagnostic Workup and Management.
31792625|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cryptogenic stroke describes a subset of ischemic stroke for which no cause can be found despite a structured investigation. There are a number of putative mechanisms of cryptogenic ischemic stroke including a covert structural cardiac lesion, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state or undiagnosed malignancy. Because many of these proposed mechanisms are embolic - and based on studies of thrombus history showing commonalities between thrombus composition between cardioembolic and cryptogenic strokes - the concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) (Hart et al. Lancet Neurol. 13(4):429-38, 2014; Stroke. 48(4):867-72, 2017) has been proposed to describe cryptogenic strokes that may warrant systemic anticoagulation. In this review, we discuss the phenomena of cryptogenic stroke, ESUS and a proposed management pathway. RECENT FINDINGS: 1. The concept of ESUS was proposed in 2014 as a potentially useful therapeutic entity. Two recent trials - NAVIGATE-ESUS (Hart et al. N Engl J Med. 378(23):2191-201, 2018) and RESPECT-ESUS (Diener 2018) were proposed based on this concept. They were negative for their primary endpoint and for the secondary endpoint of ischemic stroke recurrence. Post-hoc analysis of the WARSS trial (Longstreth et al. Stroke. 44(3):714-9, 2013) suggested that people with elevated pro-BNP benefited from systemic anticoagulation whereas those with a normal pro-BNP did not. This led to the hypothesis that a subgroup of patients at higher risk for embolism from the left atrium would benefit from anticoagulation, even if the WARSS trial was negative for the primary endpoint. Thus, the ARCADIA trial (Kamel et al. Int J Stroke. 14(2):207-14, 2019) was proposed - a randomized, active-control, multi-center trial comparing apixaban with aspirin for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ESUS and biomarkers of left atrial cardiopathy. This trial is actively recruiting. 2. Carotid web - an intimal form of fibromuscular dysplasia - has come to increased prominence in the literature as a cause of embolic stroke. It is a non-stenosis, non-atherosclerotic lesion in the posterior wall of the internal carotid artery that leads to pooling with stasis of blood distal to the lesion and, as a consequence, embolic stroke. It is not usually detected by a standard stroke workup as it masquerades as non-calcified atherosclerosis and does not cause hemodynamically significant stenosis. There have been two major recent papers - a meta-analysis in Stroke (Zhang et al. Stroke. 49(12):2872-6, 2018) and narrative review in JAMA Neurology (Kim et al. JAMA Neurol. 2018) - that addressed this topic. Cryptogenic stroke describes a stroke for which no cause has been found. ESUS is a more precisely-defined entity that mandates a specific workup and implicates remote embolism as a cause of stroke. In ESUS, the options for further investigation include long-term cardiac monitoring, transesophageal echocardiography, investigation for occult malignancy or arterial hypercoagulability. Options for management include anti-platelet therapy (the current standard of care), empiric anticoagulation or enrollment in to a clinical trial examining the use of NOACs compared with aspirin for secondary prevention (such as ARCADIA or ATTICUS). In a person less than 60 years old with ESUS and a patent foramen ovale the risk of a recurrent stroke is low but recent trials have suggested that percutaneous device closure reduces this risk further with an acceptable complication rate.

31801849|t|Intravascular Ultrasound in Carotid Web.
31801849|a|BACKGROUND: Carotid web (CaW) is a shelf-like linear filling defect in the posterior aspect of the internal carotid bulb, representing an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia. The diagnosis of CaW is traditionally restricted to digital subtraction angiography (DSA), CT/MR angiography (CTA/MRA), and Duplex ultrasonography. In this series of patients with acute ischemic stroke, we evaluated the potential utility of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in further characterizing suspected CaWs. METHODS: This is a case series of three patients with suspected CaW who underwent DSA for treatment or investigation of large vessel occlusion strokes. In all cases the stroke investigation failed to identify an alternative cause, and the stroke etiology was attributed to a symptomatic CaW. The procedure consisted of positioning a guide catheter in the common carotid artery, navigating the IVUS probe distal to the carotid bulb, and then retracting the probe with a manual pullback. The acquired images were then reviewed in an independent workstation RESULTS: In two of the three cases, IVUS showed an isoechoic-to-hyperechoic focal eccentric area at the posterior carotid bulb, consistent with CaW. The endoluminal protrusion was inconspicuous on IVUS due to the low resolution of ultrasound not allowing a clear differentiation between fibrosis, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis. No abnormalities commonly associated with atherosclerotic disease or dissections were noted. The CaW could not be depicted in the third patient. CONCLUSION: The use of IVUS in the diagnosis of CaW may have limited relevance. Continued investigation of other imaging modalities for accurate CaW diagnosis is recommended.

31869771|t|Moyamoya disease associated with fibromuscular dysplasia of intrapulmonary bronchial arteries-a case report.
31869771|a|A case is reported of a 40-year-old woman clinically diagnosed as moyamoya disease with associated fibromuscular dysplasia of intrapulmonary bronchial arteries incidentally revealed during autoptic examination. Moyamoya disease represents an idiopathic noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic arterio-occlusive process of intracranial arteries. Prolonged brain ischemia leads to formation of tiny and fragile collaterals. Clinically, patients with moyamoya angiopathy commonly present with severe neurological symptoms caused by brain infarction or hemorrhage. Histologically, the steno-occlusive process is based on fibrocellular thickening of intima and intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation. In the literature, extracranial arterial involvement, i.e. fibromuscular dysplasia of renal or pulmonary arteries, has been described in several cases of moyamoya disease. Our aim is to show a unique case of moyamoya disease associated with fibromuscular dysplasia affecting an uncommon site.

31885932|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in a Patient with a Family History of Fatal Ascending Aortic Dissection: Case Report and Discussion of Diseases Causing Both Presentations.
31885932|a|Background: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Aortic dissection and SCAD share common aetiologies such as a fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), Marfan, Ehlers Danlos, and more rarely systemic lupus erythematosus and Loeys-Dietz; however, SCAD has never been known to have a familial association with aortic dissection. Case Summary: This case report describes a 48-year-old woman suffering from SCAD who had a mother who died from ascending aortic dissection in her 50s. Discussion: This is the first case report to our knowledge of a patient with SCAD with a first-degree relative with aortic dissection. Our case is interesting in that it shows that if predisposition to arterial dissection was inherited from mother to daughter, one of them suffered an extremely rare manifestation of their underlying disease. It also shows that a high index of suspicion is needed for SCAD in the presence of a patient with ACS and a family history of dissection elsewhere in the arterial tree.

31926571|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: Clinical Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes in a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Community-Based Cohort.
31926571|a|CONTEXT: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a cause of acute coronary syndrome, which predominantly affects healthy women; however, few data define this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with SCAD and determine outcomes in a community-based cohort. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with SCAD at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during a 10-year period. We compared 111 SCAD cases with 333 healthy, matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predisposing factors, treatment modalities, and inhospital and late outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with SCAD had a mean age (standard deviation) of 48.1 (11) years; 92.8% were women, and 49.5% were nonwhite. Of women, 9% were peripartum. Fibromuscular dysplasia was identified in 21.8% of femoral angiograms obtained. With conditional logistic regression, only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were associated with SCAD compared with controls. Fifty-five patients (49.5%) were successfully treated without revascularization; of the 54 who had urgent percutaneous coronary intervention, 2 required coronary artery bypass grafting for SCAD extension. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1% of patients. Pregnancy-related SCAD was not associated with worsened outcomes. However, Emergency Department visits or hospitalizations because of recurrent chest pain occurred frequently for 54% of patients with SCAD. CONCLUSION: The study cohort is comparable to published SCAD cohorts, but notable for a racially and ethnically diverse population. Compared with the controls, only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were associated with SCAD. For the SCAD cases, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1%, and race did not influence outcomes.
