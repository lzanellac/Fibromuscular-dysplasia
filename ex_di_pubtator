31923594|t|Clinical Characteristics and Long-Term Outcomes of Mid-Aortic Syndrome.
31923594|a|OBJECTIVE: Mid-aortic syndrome (MAS) is a rare congenital or acquired condition marked by segmental or diffuse stenosis of the distal thoracic and/or abdominal aorta and its branches. The optimal approach to medical or interventional management of MAS and long-term outcomes in adults are not well defined. We reviewed MAS cases to characterize the natural history of aortic disease, identify prognostic factors and evaluate the durability of invasive interventions. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of MAS patients who presented to Memorial Hermann Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine between 1997 and 2018. We categorized cases according to demographic and clinical manifestations, etiologies, the extent of aortic involvement, interventions and vascular outcomes. RESULTS: We identified a cohort of 13 MAS patients. The etiology of MAS was identified in 6 cases, including genetic syndromes (Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (2/13), Williams syndrome (1/13), fibromuscular dysplasia (2/13), and Takayasu arteritis (1/13)). Mean age at first documented clinical event was 25.2 (2-67) years but cases with genetic etiologies presented significantly younger (18.2 years). The most common primary anatomic site was the suprarenal and infrarenal aorta (zones 5-8). Extra-aortic locations involved the renal (4/13), celiac (3/13), and superior mesenteric (3/13) arteries. Clinical manifestations included hypertension (13/13), claudication (9/13) and postprandial abdominal pain (5/13). All patients with available follow-up data underwent at least one surgical or endovascular intervention (range: 1-8). Postoperative complications included renal failure requiring post-discharge hemodialysis and respiratory failure. There were no deaths in long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MAS is a complex vasculopathy with substantial variability in clinical presentation and anatomic distribution. Extensive disease frequently requires multiple invasive interventions and results in refractory hypertension, which may predict subsequent clinical events. A multidisciplinary approach with long-term monitoring is essential for preservation of end-organ function and quality of life in this debilitating disease.

31926571|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: Clinical Characteristics, Management, and Outcomes in a Racially and Ethnically Diverse Community-Based Cohort.
31926571|a|CONTEXT: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a cause of acute coronary syndrome, which predominantly affects healthy women; however, few data define this vulnerable population. OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with SCAD and determine outcomes in a community-based cohort. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of patients with SCAD at Kaiser Permanente Northern California during a 10-year period. We compared 111 SCAD cases with 333 healthy, matched controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Predisposing factors, treatment modalities, and inhospital and late outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with SCAD had a mean age (standard deviation) of 48.1 (11) years; 92.8% were women, and 49.5% were nonwhite. Of women, 9% were peripartum. Fibromuscular dysplasia was identified in 21.8% of femoral angiograms obtained. With conditional logistic regression, only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were associated with SCAD compared with controls. Fifty-five patients (49.5%) were successfully treated without revascularization; of the 54 who had urgent percutaneous coronary intervention, 2 required coronary artery bypass grafting for SCAD extension. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1% of patients. Pregnancy-related SCAD was not associated with worsened outcomes. However, Emergency Department visits or hospitalizations because of recurrent chest pain occurred frequently for 54% of patients with SCAD. CONCLUSION: The study cohort is comparable to published SCAD cohorts, but notable for a racially and ethnically diverse population. Compared with the controls, only pregnancy and hyperlipidemia were associated with SCAD. For the SCAD cases, major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 8.1%, and race did not influence outcomes.

31932287|t|Coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome in women.
31932287|a|There are important dissimilarities in clinical presentation, aggregation of comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors and the quality of delivery of medical care among men and women with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Compared with men, despite the well-known older age and more pronounced frailty, women with ACS present later from symptom onset and are at high bleeding risk after invasive procedures. In addition, autoimmune/inflammatory disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, polycystic ovary, early menopause and history of pre-eclampsia are risk factors preceding ACS among younger women. They more often experience myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), which makes diagnosis and treatment of ACS among women more challenging compared with men. Women and men do both benefit from guideline-recommended treatment, although, compared with men, women with ACS have a higher adjusted risk of early death, which equalises between both sexes within the first year. Young women with ACS suffer frequently of depression and present often with MINOCA. Compared with young men, they (young women) have a higher risk of death. Therefore, focusing on young patients with ACS, understanding the particular physiopathology of MINOCA and developing programmes targeting comorbidities and depression-related behavioural risk factors are urgently needed.

31934918|t|Lung Transplantation for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Adults: A Clinical and Pathologic Study of 3 Cases.
31934918|a|Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is usually seen in premature infants who require mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory distress. Although most patients wean from oxygen therapy by the ages of 2 to 3, rehospitalization for respiratory problems is common in these patients in adulthood. There have been few studies that document the long-term outcomes of BPD survivors and information about the pulmonary function and radiographic findings of adult BPD are limited. Data on pathologic features of adult BPD are scarce. Three adult patients who underwent recent lung transplantation for BPD from 2 institutions were identified. Clinical data including clinical presentation, chest radiographic images, pulmonary function tests, cardiac catheterization, and echocardiography were retrieved from the electronic medical records. Hematoxylin and eosin and selective elastic stained sections of the explant lungs were examined. CD31 immunohistochemical stain is performed on representative sections. All 3 cases had similar clinical and radiologic features including the history of prematurity and long-term mechanical ventilation after birth, hyperexpanded lungs with air trapping and mosaic attenuation on chest computed tomographic scan, severe obstructive changes on pulmonary function test, and pulmonary hypertension. Pathologic examination showed common features including enlarged and simplified alveoli, peribronchial, subpleural, and interlobular septal fibrosis, narrowing/obliteration of the small airways by elastosis and muscular hypertrophy, thickening of venous walls by fibromuscular hyperplasia, and bronchitis/bronchiolitis. Cholesterol granulomas were seen in 2 cases. The common pathologic findings in the lungs explain the clinical and radiologic findings. Future studies are warranted to further characterize the clinical and pathologic features of adult BPD to develop optimal management strategies for these patients.

31937096|t|Detection of significant left renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia with selective angiography.
31937096|a|A 22-year-old female, was referred with a history of a headache and elevated blood pressure without family history of hypertension or familial dyslipidemia. Initially, a spiral computed tomographic angiography of the renal arteries was conducted, demonstrating completely abnormal left renal artery at the medial portion of the vessel with suspicious stenosis, which was supposed to be due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Subsequently, the patient underwent selective renal angiography and balloon angioplasty. Severe stenosis was observed on the left side and moderate stenosis on the right side in the medial and proximal part of the vessels, respectively. After the diagnosis of FMD, the left side was treated by balloon and finally, the patient was discharged with good control of blood pressure by losartan/amlodipine treatment.

31943685|t|Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with selective stenting for the treatment of renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia: 18 years' experience from the China Center for Cardiovascular Disease.
31943685|a|OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficiency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with selective stenting treating Chinese patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). BACKGROUND: Endovascular data of patients with RAS caused by FMD are scarce in China. METHODS: Clinical data of 105 hypertensive patients with RAS caused by FMD underwent endovascular therapy at a single-site between June 2001 and October 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. Baseline blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medications, renal function, and adverse events at a 1-year follow-up were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients were aged between 10 and 64 years (mean age 26.7 +- 8.2 years) and 52 (49.5%) were female. In total, 105 patients undergoing endovascular therapy involving 124 RASs. Thirty (24.2%), sixty-four (51.6%), and thirty (24.2%) RASs were multifocal, unifocal, and tubular types, respectively. Ninety-four (89.5%) and eleven (10.5%) patients underwent PTA alone and PTA plus stenting, respectively. The technical success rate for endovascular therapy was 95.2% (100/105) without severe complications. During 1-year follow-up (n = 100), the mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 157.6 +- 17.5 and 102.3 +- 14.2 to 129.6 +- 12.3 and 81.3 +- 11.1 mmHg, respectively, and the number of antihypertensive medications reduced from 2.2 +- 1.2 to 0.8 +- 1.0 (all p &lt; .001). The cure rate and improved rate of blood pressure was 49.0 and 40.0%, respectively. The serum creatinine levels remained stable. The primary and secondary restenosis rate was 13.4 and 5.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy for treating RAS caused by FMD was technically safe and effective for reducing blood pressure in Chinese patients.

31994838|a|Coronary fibromuscular dysplasia is uncommon, and even rarer its unstable and recurrent course. We present the unique case of a 52-year-old woman who underwent in total 12 coronary angiographies and three percutaneous coronary intervention within 24 months because of repetitive acute coronary syndromes due to refractory spasm, dissection, restenosis all leading to end-stage heart failure, and heart transplantation. The patient died 12 days after the heart transplantation complicated by intraoperative acute thrombotic occlusion of left anterior descending artery of the graft despite normal pretransplant coronary angiography. Autopsy of the recipient heart confirmed coronary fibromuscular dysplasia with massive intimal hyperplasia and restenosis.

31996160|t|Unexpected presentation and surgical salvage of transplant renal artery dissection caused by vascular clamping: a case report.
31996160|a|BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery dissection is a rare and serious event that can cause allograft dysfunction and activation of the renin-mediated renovascular hypertension. Most cases are induced by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, arteriosclerotic disease, or fibromuscular dysplasia. We observed a case of transplant renal artery dissection induced by unusual causes during kidney transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old woman, whose mother donated a kidney to her, underwent ABO-incompatible living kidney transplantation. The allograft had one renal artery and vein that were anastomosed to the internal iliac artery and external iliac vein, respectively. Although careful handling was performed in all procedures including vascular clamping, Doppler ultrasonography (US) immediately after reperfusion showed an increase in the systolic blood velocity and urine output was not observed. Arterial anastomotic stenosis was suspected, but upon exploration, a renal artery dissection was detected in the middle portion of the donor artery. The part of the transplant renal artery was resected, and cold reflux was started again. At the resected part of transplant renal artery, dissection was identified. After re-anastomosis, Doppler US revealed that the blood flow of the renal artery was adequate without an increase in the systolic blood velocity, and sufficient blood flow was observed throughout the allograft. Urine output was also observed as soon as blood flow returned, and serum creatinine level decreased to 0.95 mg/dL after surgery. The cause of injury might have been vascular clamping in order to drain the air and check bleeding at the anastomosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our case reaffirmed that careful handling is needed in all procedures, including donor nephrectomy, cannulation for transplant perfusion, vascular clamping, and anastomosis, even without any evidence of arteriosclerosis. Kidney transplant recipients commonly have atherosclerosis and hypertension, which are risk factors for arterial dissection. Early diagnosis and intervention can lead to the prevention of allograft dysfunction. Therefore, close monitoring of allograft blood flow by Doppler US during surgery should be considered.

32076589|t|Isolated Renal Artery Dissection: A Systematic Review of Case Reports.
32076589|a|Isolated renal artery dissection (IRAD) is a rare and often unrecognized clinical entity, with a paucity of data on its epidemiology and management. We extracted 129 cases of IRAD from the medical literature between 1972 and 2016. IRAD as a result of an extended dissection from the aorta and splanchnic or mesenteric arteries was excluded. The mean age of presentation was 42.7+-12.9 years, with a male predominance (79%). Abdominal pain (75.9%) was the most common presenting symptom. Etiology was more likely to be spontaneous (76%) than traumatic (12%), iatrogenic (9%), or drug-induced (1.5%). The most common risk factors were hypertension (28.7%), fibromuscular dysplasia (8.5%), and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (5.4%). Unilateral renal artery dissection (right 45.5%, left 40.5%) was more frequent than bilateral (14%). More than half (56.6%) of the cohort were managed medically (blood pressure control and /or anticoagulation). Of those who underwent intervention, endovascular stenting or embolization (35%) was utilized more frequently than nephrectomy or bypass (21%). Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have the highest diagnostic sensitivity (91% and 93%, respectively) as compared to ultrasonography (27%). A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to diagnose IRAD. CT and MRI have a higher diagnostic sensitivity. As compared to invasive management, conservative management has comparable outcomes.

32081546|t|[Bilateral renal infarction: A rare complication of fibromuscular dysplasia].
32081546|a|Bilateral renal infarction complicating Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is extremely rare and has so far been reported only in a handful of cases. We report a 44-year-old man who presented with complaints of abdominal pain and severe hypertension. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed bilateral renal infarction and a renal angiography confirmed the bilateral and irregular stenosis due to FMD, in the absence of systemic vasculitis and other risk factors for thromboembolic events. Therefore, angioplasty with balloon was performed in order to obtain a good vessel patency and to improve patency in the long term follow-up. After the endovascular treatment the blood pressure improved markedly, maintaining this result at 3-months follow-up. Our case highlight the importance of recognizing renal infarction as an initial presentation of FMD.

32093171|t|Efficacy of Antihypertensive Therapy in a Child with Unilateral Focal Fibromuscular Dysplasia of the Renal Artery: A Case Study and Review of Literature.
32093171|a|Background: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is one of the important etiologies of renovascular hypertension in children. It is usually resistant to multiple antihypertensive agents and can cause extreme elevation in blood pressures, which can lead to end organ damage if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Treatment options include medical management with antihypertensive agents, balloon or stent angioplasties, surgical revascularization, and nephrectomy. The aim of the study was to review the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy only in the management of FMD in a very young child. Methods: This is a retrospective chart study with review of literature. Results: Here, we report a 22-month-old toddler who presented with severe resistant hypertension and cardiomyopathy who was found to have focal FMD of the right renal artery. She also presented with proteinuria, hyponatremia that was probably secondary to pressure natriuresis, hypokalemia, hyperaldosteronism, and elevated plasma renin activity. The stabilization of blood pressures was done medically with the usage of antihypertensive medications only, without the need for angioplasty or surgical revascularization. Conclusions: We demonstrate that surgical intervention may not always be necessary in the treatment of all cases of FMD, especially in a small child where such intervention may be technically challenging and lead to potential complications. Hence, medical management alone may be sufficient, at least for the short-term, in small children with controlled hypertension and normal renal function, with surgical intervention reserved for FMD with medication-refractory hypertension and/or compromised renal function.

32094235|t|Fibromuscular dysplasia presenting with a deep vein thrombosis.
32094235|a|A 41-year-old male patient presented with isolated right lower limb swelling. An ultrasound scan showed right external iliac and femoral vein deep vein thrombosis due to extrinsic compression by an aneurysm of the right common iliac artery. Investigations including imaging and a tissue biopsy of right and left femoral arteries confirmed a rare clinical presentation of fibromuscular dysplasia involving iliac, coeliac, renal and pulmonary vessels. The common iliac artery aneurysm was successfully treated with endovascular repair. Six months later, he developed coronary artery involvement with spontaneous dissection of left anterior descending artery diagnosed on coronary angiogram which was managed conservatively. At 6-year follow-up, he remains clinically asymptomatic and continues with regular surveillance imaging. Iliac arterial fibromuscular dysplasia is uncommon and clinical presentation with a complication such as a deep vein thrombosis is atypical.

32123677|t|How to Repair Non-Atheromatous Carotid Lesions.
32123677|a|Non-atheromatous surgical lesions are estimated to represent at most 10% of all carotid procedures, most of which involve atheromatous lesions. Isolated tortuosity of the carotid vessels is sometimes treated surgically. The pathologies most frequently studied are extra-cranial carotid aneurysms, dissections, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Behcet's disease only rarely affects the carotid trunk, but in view of its prevalence in our country of Algeria a short section will be devoted to it. A series of 57 patients treated for non-atheromatous carotid lesions is presented article. These cases were treated using both endovascular and conventional surgical techniques. A review of the literature shows that endovascular treatment is now replacing conventional surgery for most indications except carotid paraganglioma.

32148126|t|Systematic and Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Fibromuscular Dysplasia Patients Reveals High Prevalence of Previously Undetected Fibromuscular Dysplasia Lesions and Affects Clinical Decisions: The ARCADIA-POL Study.
32148126|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), regarded as a generalized vascular disease, may affect all vascular beds and may result in arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, or dissection. It has been proposed to systematically evaluate all vascular beds in patients with FMD, regardless of initial FMD involvement. However, the impact of this approach on clinical decisions and on management is unknown. Within the prospective ARCADIA-POL study (Assessment of Renal and Cervical Artery Dysplasia-Poland), we evaluated 232 patients with FMD lesions confirmed in at least one vascular bed, out of 343 patients included in the registry. All patients underwent a detailed clinical evaluation including computed tomography angiography of intracranial and cervical arteries, as well as computed tomography angiography of the abdominal aorta, its branches, and upper and lower extremity arteries. In the study group, FMD lesions were most frequently found in renal arteries (87.5%). FMD was also found in cerebrovascular (24.6%), mesenteric (13.8%), and upper (3.0%) and lower extremity (9.9 %) arteries. Newly diagnosed FMD lesions were found in 34.1% of the patients, and previously undetected vascular complications were found in 25% of the patients. Among all FMD patients included in the study, one out of every 4 evaluated patients qualified for interventional treatment due to newly diagnosed FMD lesions or vascular complications. The ARCADIA-POL study shows for the first time that the systematic and multidisciplinary evaluation of patients with FMD based on a whole-body computed tomography angiography scan has an impact on their clinical management. This proved the necessity of the systematic evaluation of all vascular beds in patients with FMD, regardless of initial FMD involvement.

32153091|t|A simple refined approach for renovascular hypertension in children: a ten-year experience.
32153091|a|BACKGROUND: Despite advances in noninvasive vascular imaging, detection of renal artery stenosis via catheter angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension (RVH). Due to lack of evidence, the utility of various blood tests and imaging modalities remains unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the utility of blood tests [plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone, and renal vein renin values] and imaging studies [computed tomography (CT) angiography, kidney ultrasonography (US)] by comparing them with renal angiography. Ten pediatric patients with RVH at two institutions from January 2008 to December 2016 were recruited. The sensitivities for diagnosing RVH via imaging and blood tests (kidney US, PRA, and aldosterone) were derived by examining patient records. Furthermore, the sensitivity and specificity of CT angiography were calculated by considering the both the affected and non-affected renal arteries of the patients. RESULTS: A high sensitivity for diagnosing RVH via kidney US (89%) and PRA (80%) was observed. The sensitivity and specificity of CT angiography were 100%, each. Renal vein renin sampling did not aid in the diagnosis of RVH; only 2 of 6 patients with unilateral RVH showed significant laterality of renal vein renin boundary ratios. Renal scintigraphy facilitated detection of a nonfunctional kidney (split renal function <5%). CONCLUSIONS: RVH in children could be diagnosed utilizing noninvasive blood and imaging tests without catheter angiography. We recommend kidney size measurement along with measurement of PRA level as a simple and highly useful screening test followed by CT angiography as a diagnostic test.

32161950|t|Impact of percutaneous revascularization on left ventricular mass and its relationship to outcome in hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis.
32161950|a|BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty on left ventricular (LV) mass, and the impact of LV mass reduction on outcomes. METHODS: A total of 144 hypertensive patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS) (mean age 69 years; 22.2% fibromuscular dysplasia [FMD]) who underwent angioplasty were included. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and after one year, and patients were thereafter followed up for a median of 5.6 years for primary composite outcomes. RESULTS: In both the FMD and atherosclerotic stenosis (ARAS) groups, LV mass decreased after angioplasty, but the decrease in LV mass index (-15.4+-18.3% versus -0.8+-27.8%, p <0.01) as well as the regression rate of LV hypertrophy was greater in FMD. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that FMD (odds ratio [OR] 2.94, p <0.01), severe RAS (>=90%) (OR 2.94, p <0.05), and higher LV mass index at baseline (OR 2.94 for 1 standard deviation increase, p <0.001) were independent predictors of LV mass index decrease of at least 20%. The primary composite outcomes occurred in 45 patients (31.3%). In FMD, lower LV mass index after one year (hazard ratio 2.81 for 1 standard deviation increase, p <0.05) or regression of LV mass (hazard ratio 0.75 for 5% decrease, p=0.054) showed a tendency to be associated with better outcomes; however, these associations were not found in ARAS. CONCLUSION: Hypertensive patients with ARAS have less regression of LV mass in response to angioplasty than those with FMD, and LV mass regression is less useful as a surrogate marker of outcomes especially in ARAS.
