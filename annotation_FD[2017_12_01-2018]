27854110|t|Association between carotid artery tortuosity and carotid dissection: a case-control study.
27854110|a|BACKGROUND: Carotid artery dissections have long been associated with compromise of the structural integrity of the arterial wall from heritable connective-tissue disorders, hypertension, and trauma. However, an association between spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection and tortuous or redundant carotid anatomy has not been fully explored. METHODS: Patients with CTA confirmed spontaneous cervical internal carotid artery dissections were compared to a group of age and sex matched controls who also received CTA of the neck. Patients with trauma or aortic dissections were excluded. Five radiologists reviewed the CTA images to evaluate internal carotid artery tortuosity (reported as loops, kinks or coils), retrojugular and retropharyngeal courses of the internal carotid artery, presence of fibromuscular dysplasia and presence of atherosclerotic disease. Baseline data collected included demographic characteristics (sex, age, smoking history) and cardiovascular comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 83 cervical internal carotid artery dissection and their age and sex matched controls were included in this study. 46% of patients were female in each group and mean age was 49.2+-10.6 years. The presence of any carotid tortuosity was 53% (N.=44) and 34% (N.=28) in the per-patient analysis of dissection and control groups, respectively (P=0.02). Loops were reported in 22% (N.=18) of dissection patients and 8% (N.=7) of controls (P=0.03). Retrojugular course of the internal carotid artery were seen in 23% (N.=38) of dissection patients and 9% (N.=15) of controls (P=0.0009) in the per-vessel analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that there is an association between the presence of tortuous carotid artery anatomy and spontaneous carotid artery dissection. This finding emphasizes the importance of the presence of tortuous arteries on CTA imaging to increase the index of suspicion for a potential dissection.

28056533|t|Hemicrania continua in carotid artery dissection - symptomatic cases or linked pathophysiology?
28056533|a|Background Hemicrania continua (HC) -like headaches have been rarely reported as symptomatic headaches, including cases secondary to cervical artery dissection. Case series We present five cases of HC-like headaches following cervical artery dissection, in three cases with specific indomethacin response. In two cases, comorbidity of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was noted. Conclusion Carotid artery dissection may result in an HC-like headache syndrome. A specific response to indomethacin does not rule out dissection as underlying pathology. Screening for extracranial manifestations of FMD should be considered, especially in middle-aged females.

28272662|t|Fibromuscular Dysplasia of the Coronary Arteries: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
28272662|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic and non-inflammatory vascular disease with primary lesion of renal and internal carotid arteries. We present a neonatal case of fibromuscular dysplasia who died on the second day of life. The newborn suffered from fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary arteries and a congenital heart defect. The interesting feature of this case was the formation of aneurysms of the coronary arteries with pulmonary atresia. This case demonstrates a casuistically rare form of association between fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary arteries and pulmonary artery atresia.

28574637|t|Efficacy and safety of gadobutrol-enhanced MRA of the renal arteries: Results from GRAMS (Gadobutrol-enhanced renal artery MRA study), a prospective, intraindividual multicenter phase 3 blinded study.
28574637|a|PURPOSE: To compare the performance of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with 1M gadobutrol, a high relaxivity macrocyclic contrast agent, to 2D time-of-flight MRA (ToF-MRA) using computed tomographic angiography (CTA) as the standard of reference. Primary objectives were evaluation for superiority of structural delineation and noninferiority for detection and exclusion of clinically significant disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 315 subjects underwent unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRA with 1M gadobutrol (CE-MRA) and were scanned with 1.5T MRI equipped with an at least 6-element body coil. Evaluations were based on both centralized blinded read (BR) performed by six readers as well as investigator site interpretations for the 292 subjects who completed the study. Quantitative evaluations including percent stenosis and normal vessel measurements were also performed. Secondary endpoints included identification of accessory renal arteries, diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), diagnostic confidence, and need for additional imaging. RESULTS: A total of 292 patients suspected of renal artery disease completed the study. CE-MRA demonstrated statistically significant improvement in assessability of vascular segments compared to ToF: 95.9% vs. 77.6% (P &lt; 0.0001). In the BR, the sensitivity and specificity of CE-MRA were noninferior to ToF-MRA (53.4% vs. 46.6% and 95.1% vs. 85.7%, respectively). There was less error in the CE-MRA stenosis measurements (0.15 mm gadobutrol vs. 0.41 mm ToF, P &lt; 0.05). FMD was correctly diagnosed more frequently, 10% more accessory renal arteries were identified (P &lt; 0.01), diagnostic confidence increased (P &lt; 0.01), and fewer additional imaging studies were recommended (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Gadobutrol-enhanced MRA of the renal arteries has superior visualization, more accurate vessel measurements, and may serve as a CTA alternative without any ionizing radiation.

28657457|t|The spectrum of spontaneous coronary artery dissection: illustrated review of the literature.
28657457|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection or SCAD is a rare and challenging disease that is increasingly diagnosed. It is characterized by a non-traumatic, non-iatrogenic separation of the coronary artery wall and occurs predominantly in young and middle-aged women without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. SCAD is often associated with predisposing conditions such as the peripartum period, systemic inflammatory disease and heritable connective tissue disease. More recently, independent investigators have demonstrated an important association with fibromuscular dysplasia. Extreme emotional or physical stress as well as intense hormonal therapy or drug abuse have been pointed out as precipitating factors. The diagnosis of SCAD can be challenging and starts with clinical suspicion. Advanced imaging techniques such as intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography are useful for the differentiation from atherosclerotic disease and are increasingly used for this indication. The proposed treatment in the acute setting is based on findings from single-centre retrospective series: in stable patients with a TIMI-flow &gt;=2 a conservative management is proposed because of the high risk of procedural failure and complications as well as a high probability of spontaneous healing. Long-term treatment is comparable to that in non-SCAD acute coronary syndromes (ACS) but dual antiplatelet therapy should only be started in case of stenting and should be kept as short as possible in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Prognosis seems to be better compared to non-SCAD ACS but there is a reasonable risk of recurrence. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of SCAD and provide a clinical pathway for the diagnosis, management and work-up of SCAD patients.

28891472|t|Characteristics of extension and de novo recurrent spontaneous coronary artery dissection.
28891472|a|AIMS: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an under-recognised and important cause of myocardial infarction in young women. Recurrent SCAD is frequent but poorly understood. We aimed to explore the clinical and angiographic characteristics, and outcomes of recurrent SCAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with SCAD extension or recurrence prospectively followed at Vancouver General Hospital were included in this retrospective study. SCAD diagnosis was confirmed by two experienced cardiologists. Detailed medical history, baseline demographics, angiographic results, and clinical details of index SCAD and recurrent events were recorded. SCAD extension was defined as angiographic extension of a previously dissected coronary segment, and de novo recurrent SCAD was defined as new spontaneous dissection. We identified 43 patients with SCAD recurrence with mean age 48.9+-8.4 years; 38/43 were women, and 32/43 had fibromuscular dysplasia. Nine patients had SCAD extension at median time of five (1-19) days, while 34 patients had de novo recurrent SCAD at median time of 1,487 (107- 6,461) days after the index SCAD event. All SCAD extension patients had worsening of the index dissected segment, with 5/9 involving extension to adjacent segments, while all de novo recurrent SCAD patients had new dissections affecting coronary segments distinct from the index dissection. CONCLUSIONS: De novo recurrent SCAD invariably affected new segments distinct from previously dissected segments.

29045340|t|Cause of renal infarction: a retrospective analysis of 186 consecutive cases.
29045340|a|BACKGROUND: Renal infarction can cause abrupt and severe hypertension and less frequently renal failure. Renal infarction results from disruption of renal blood flow in the main ipsilateral renal artery or in a segmental branch. Underlying mechanism is either general, 'embolic' or 'thrombophilic', or local related to primary 'renal artery lesion'. It depends on various causes. In absence of an identified cause, renal infarction is classified as 'idiopathic'. Previous studies report a significant number of 'idiopathic' renal infarction. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze various renal infarction causes. METHODS: Between July 2000 and June 2015, 259 consecutive patients with renal infarction were admitted to our hospital center and retrospectively identified from weekly multidisciplinary round. Main clinical and biological characteristics were extracted from clinical data warehouse. Renal imaging was reviewed by two readers unaware of the diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 259 initially identified patients, 30 were excluded owing to a lack of imaging or clinical data and 43 because iatrogenic renal infarction. In the 186 studied patients, dissection was observed in 76 patients (40.8%) and occlusion in 75 (40.3%). Renal infarction mechanisms were 'renal artery lesion' (n = 151; 81.2%), 'embolic' (n = 17; 9.1%), 'thrombophilic' (n = 11; 5.9%) and 'idiopathic' (n = 7; 3.8%). Predominant renal artery lesions were atherosclerosis disease (n = 52; 34.4%) followed by dissecting hematoma (n = 35; 23.2%) and fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 29; 19.2%). Right and left kidneys were equally involved. CONCLUSION: Renal artery lesion is the most frequent cause of renal infarction. This result underlines the need for extensive arterial exploration to identify the renal infarction mechanism and, in case of renal artery lesion, the underlying vascular disease.

29068131|t|Renal artery stenosis and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: A case report and review of the literature.
29068131|a|Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a prevalent cause of secondary hypertension. Elderly patients with atherosclerosis and young women with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) are particularly at risk. Blood pressure screening is often key to this diagnosis, although the reliability of clinical screening has been questioned, and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) likely offers superior ability to diagnose poorly controlled hypertension. In patients with RAS, medical management should be the primary means of therapy; however, in a select group of these patients, renal revascularization may be considered, and has been shown to reduce blood pressure and stabilize chronic kidney disease. In this report, we present a patient diagnosed with RAS due to FMD, found to have significant hypertension via ABPM, and treated successfully with percutaneous renal artery angioplasty; importantly, continuous 24-hr ambulatory monitoring after pressure gradient guided renal angioplasty confirmed reduction in blood pressure.

29095703|t|Sudden Death Due to Cystic Tumor of the Atrioventricular Node and Fibromuscular Dysplasia Involving Branches of the Coronary Arteries.
29095703|a|In this paper, we report the autopsy findings of a 42-year-old White male who was found deceased at his home by his brother in the early morning hours with a history of excessive alcohol consumption 1 day before his death. A medical record review revealed chronic alcohol use with alcohol dependence syndrome, hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias by electrocardiogram 2 years prior. External examination revealed only a single bruise on the forehead. Internal examination revealed changes associated with chronic alcohol abuse and mild atherosclerosis. The lack of a cause of death at autopsy resulted in a dissection of the cardiac conduction system and the detection of a small cystic lesion at the atrioventricular node region. Microscopic examination revealed a cystic tumor of the atrioventricular node and fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary artery branches near the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. Based on the case history and autopsy findings, death was attributed to a fatal cardiac arrhythmia due to cystic tumor of the atrioventricular node with fibromuscular dysplasia of the coronary artery branches near the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes a possible contributing factor.

29099499|t|Carotid-cavernous fistula: current concepts in aetiology, investigation, and management.
29099499|a|A carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is an abnormal communication between arteries and veins within the cavernous sinus and may be classified as either direct or dural. Direct CCFs are characterized by a direct connection between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the cavernous sinus, whereas dural CCFs result from an indirect connection involving cavernous arterial branches and the cavernous sinus. Direct CCFs frequently are traumatic in origin and also may be caused by rupture of an ICA aneurysm within the cavernous sinus, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, or iatrogenic intervention. Causes of dural CCFs include hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos type IV, and dissection of the ICA. Evaluation of a suspected CCF often involves non-invasive imaging techniques, including standard tonometry, pneumotonometry, ultrasound, computed tomographic scanning and angiography, and/or magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, but the gold standard for classification and diagnosis remains digital subtraction angiography. When a direct CCF is confirmed, first-line treatment is endovascular intervention, which may be accomplished using detachable balloons, coils, liquid embolic agents, or a combination of these tools. As dural CCFs often resolve spontaneously, low-risk cases may be managed conservatively. When invasive treatment is warranted, endovascular intervention or stereotactic radiosurgery may be performed. Modern endovascular techniques offer the ability to successfully treat CCFs with a low morbidity and virtually no mortality.

29108502|t|Colonic Adventitial Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Nonspecific Arteriopathy Associated With Hirschsprung Disease and Other Obstructive Disorders.
29108502|a|Background Smooth muscle differentiation ("adventitial fibromuscular dysplasia," AFD) was purported as specific to arteries in the transition zone of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) patients. We investigated AFD in an HSCR population and controls and consider the pathogenesis and significance of the vascular pathology. Design Vascular histology in sections from colonic HSCR resections (n = 55) was compared with age- and site-matched controls with (n = 19) and without (n = 28) non-HSCR obstructive conditions. Vascular pathology was mapped, and correlations were sought between the vascular findings and bowel distension, inflammation, neuromuscular anatomy, preoperative clinical variables, and postsurgical complications. Results One of 2 forms of AFD was identified in 42% (23/55) of the HSCR resections: the previously described "mature" form with adventitial bundles of differentiated smooth muscle cells (7/23, all submucosal) and a newly described "immature" AFD characterized by densely packed myofibroblasts in the arterial adventitia (16/23, 3 submucosal, 3 serosal, and 10 both). Adventitial inflammation and/or medial necrosis was present in the immature form (6/16). Mature submucosal AFD was present in 2/28 (7.1%) nonobstructive and 5/19 (26%) obstructive non-HSCR controls ( P = .10). Immature AFD was only found in less than 1-month-olds, and mature AFD only in older patients, including the 7 affected controls. AFD did not correlate with sex, syndromic status, length of the aganglionic segment, or postoperative complications. AFD was present in grossly dilated (17/23) and narrowed (10/23) regions and in the aganglionic (2/23), ganglionic (14/23), or both (7/23) segments. In several cases, AFD existed proximal to the histological transition zone. Conclusion AFD occurs in HSCR and other obstructive conditions but is significantly less common in the colons of patients with no history of dysmotility. The pathology likely progresses from a reversible accumulation of myofibroblasts in neonates to a stable population of mature smooth muscle cells. The distribution of vascular lesions does not correlate with neuropathological findings and suggests a nonspecific form of vascular injury, possibly related to bowel distension. AFD in HSCR resections has not been shown to be clinically significant and should not influence management.

29142493|t|Cervical Arterial Fibromuscular Dysplasia in a Biethnic Population: A Retrospective Study in the U.S.-Mexican Border.
29142493|a|Background  There have been studies trying to characterize Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD); however, most of them are based in mainly non-Hispanic sample. The objective of this study is to better understand the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of craniocervical FMD in the Hispanic population. Methods  We retrospectively reviewed the cerebral angiograms performed in our center in a period of 3.5 years under any indication looking for angiographic patterns of FMD. Exclusion criteria consisted of cases in which the first angiogram was done when the patients were younger than 18 years. Patients were subdivided based on those with FMD and those without it for baseline characteristics and were looked for any associations. We further compared the same baseline characteristics among Hispanic FMD and non-Hispanic FMD population. A chart review was conducted looking for clinical features and vascular events. Results  We analyzed 448 angiograms among patients younger than 18 years. We identified 47 patients with evidence of FMD involving the cervical arteries and 401 patients without FMD. Of the 47 patients with FMD in our neuroendovascular registry, we found that 76.6% were women and 57.4% were Hispanics. There was no statistical significant difference when comparing the variables across ethnicities, except history of cigarette smoking and dyslipidemia. The most common associated supra-aortic arterial lesions seen in the FMD group were intracranial aneurysm and arterial dissections. We then used same variables to compare Hispanic FMD with non-Hispanic FMD. We have found that there has been a positive association of cigarette smoking and dyslipidemia with FMD ( p &lt;= 0.05). Conclusion  Our study suggests that FMD affecting the carotid and vertebral arteries has similar demographic pattern across ethnicities in the United States. In Hispanics, the disease appears to have a predilection for women and history of cigarette smoking. Intracranial aneurysm and arterial dissection were the most commonly associated arterial lesions.

29191528|t|Web Vessels: Literature Review and Neurointerventional Management.
29191528|a|OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe 27 patients with 32 web vessels (WVs) from our practice and provide a review of the literature regarding imaging diagnostics, clinical presentation, and treatment of WVs. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using combinations of the following terms: "stroke in young adults," "web," "recurrent stroke," "diaphragm-like," "atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia," "atypical fibromuscular dysplasia," "septal fibromuscular dysplasia," "septa," "diaphragms," "pseudovalvular folds," and "carotid diaphragm." Our series was added in this review. RESULTS: According to location, there were 88 carotid WVs (91.66%), 7 vertebral WVs (7.3%), and 1 subclavian WV (1.04%). According to clinical presentation, the reported WVs caused stroke in 81 cases (84.38%). Treatment was supportive care in 46 cases (47.91%), surgery in 33 cases (35.41%), and an endovascular procedure through angioplasty and stenting in 17 cases (17.7%). Variables such as age (P = 0.7565), sex (P = 0.6912), and location (P = 0.7993) were not shown to be risk factors for stroke in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although few cases have been reported in the literature, the stroke rate in patients with WVs is high. Endovascular treatment is presented as an effective form of treatment with no associated morbidities or recurrences of ischemic events.

29274451|t|Treatment of Progressive Herpes Zoster-Induced Vasculopathy with Surgical Revascularization: Effects on Cerebral Hemodynamics.
29274451|a|BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is caused by reactivation of the herpes simplex virus in the trigeminal nerve. HZO-initiated cerebral vasculopathy is well characterized; however, there are no documented cases that report the efficacy of surgical revascularization for improving cerebral hemodynamics following progressive HZO-induced vasculopathy. We present a case in which quantitative anatomic and hemodynamic imaging were performed longitudinally before and after surgical revascularization in a patient with HZO and vasculopathic changes. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old female with history of right-sided HZO presented with left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria and multiple acute infarcts. Angiography performed serially over a 2-month duration revealed progressive middle cerebral artery stenosis, development of new moyamoya-like lenticulostriate collaterals, and evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia in cervical portions of the internal carotid artery. Hemodynamic imaging revealed right hemisphere decreased blood flow and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. In addition to medical therapy, right-sided surgical revascularization was performed with the intent to reestablish blood flow. Follow-up imaging 13 months post revascularization demonstrated improved blood flow and vascular reserve capacity in the operative hemisphere, which paralleled symptom resolution. CONCLUSIONS: HZO can lead to progressive, symptomatic intracranial stenoses. This report suggests that surgical revascularization techniques can improve cerebral hemodynamics and symptomatology in patients with aggressive disease when medical management is unsuccessful; similar procedures could be considered in managing HZO patients with advanced or progressive vasculopathy.

29275928|t|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD): The underdiagnosed cardiac condition that plagues women.
29275928|a|Coronary heart disease (CHD) continues to be understudied, underdiagnosed, and undertreated in women. Gender and age bias complicate the evaluation of women with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). As a result, conditions like spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) are often missed. SCAD is an infrequent yet important cause of myocardial infarction (MI) with a predilection for young to middle aged women. The condition is thought to be under-reported, likely a result of both low index of suspicion as well as an unfamiliarity with SCAD's angiographic variants. Recently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) detailed an assessment pathway for patients with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), a subset of which includes patients with SCAD. The pathway highlights the role of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in addition to intracoronary imaging for increased diagnostic yield. Early and proper diagnosis is crucial in SCAD given the potential for sudden cardiac death, as well as the increased risk for future cardiac events including recurrent dissection. In addition, SCAD has frequently been associated with underlying connective tissue disease and/or arteriopathy, most commonly fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which requires careful screening. The lack of consensus on investigation or treatment highlights the need for increased awareness and further research to better understand this challenging entity.

29317976|t|Postpartum Sudden Cardiac Death After Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in a Patient With Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29317976|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare entity that can cause acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death (SCD) which often goes unrecognized. We report a case of SCAD in a young postpartum female who presented with sudden cardiac arrest. The patient was managed medically and found to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). After being stabilized in the critical care unit, coronary angiography was performed which showed dissection of the left main artery, intramural hematoma, and the culprit lesion. Further investigation showed dissection of the left vertebral artery which was all consistent with a diagnosis of FMD. The patient was followed as an outpatient and a repeated coronary angiography demonstrated healed dissection site. In conclusion, this case exemplifies that prompt diagnosis along with medical management without the need of coronary artery bypass graft, and percutaneous coronary intervention can improve survival in SCAD.

29331613|t|Internal Carotid Artery Web as the Cause of Recurrent Cryptogenic Ischemic Stroke.
29331613|a|Carotid artery web is considered an exceptional cause of recurrent ischemic strokes in the affected arterial territory. The underlying pathology proposed for this entity is an atypical fibromuscular dysplasia. We present the case of a 43-year-old woman with no cardiovascular risk factors who had experienced 2 cryptogenic ischemic strokes in the same arterial territory within an 11-month period. Although all diagnostic tests initially yielded normal results, detailed analysis of the computed tomography angiography images revealed a carotid web; catheter angiography subsequently confirmed the diagnosis. Carotid surgery was performed, since which time the patient has remained completely asymptomatic. The histological finding of intimal hyperplasia is consistent with previously reported cases of carotid artery web. Carotid artery web is an infrequent cause of stroke, and this diagnosis requires a high level of suspicion plus a detailed analysis of vascular imaging studies.

29359368|t|B-Flow and B-Mode Ultrasound Imaging in Carotid Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29359368|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous ultrasound studies in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) have largely reported on color flow imaging, power Doppler, and Doppler flow augmentation. We here report on arterial wall imaging findings by B-flow and B-mode in patients with carotid FMD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed ultrasonographic findings in subjects with known or suspected FMD. All patients were evaluated with a standardized imaging protocol including Doppler, B-mode, and B-flow. Vessel wall abnormalities were classified as normal, luminal irregularities, or classical beading (fusiform dilatations). RESULTS: We identified 23 patients and 33 carotid arteries were found to be abnormal, of which 10 had classical beading and 23 showed endoluminal irregularities. Bilateral disease was present in 10/23 patients. In the classical beading cases, B-mode revealed isoechoic ridges, which protruded into the lumen, alternating with dilated arterial segments, which were also clearly demonstrated by B-flow imaging. In cases with endoluminal irregularities, B-mode and B-flow showed isoechoic subendothelial irregular thickening, which did not lead to a fusiform dilatory appearance of the artery. The average distal internal carotid artery peak systolic velocity of arteries with classical beading (123 +- 29 cm/second) was significantly greater than that of arteries with mild irregularities (94 +- 34 cm/second) (P = .024). CONCLUSION: Morphological arterial wall changes of FMD were well depicted by careful B-flow and B-mode imaging of the distal internal carotid artery. We would like to emphasize the utility of B-flow and B-mode in the noninvasive evaluation of FMD.

29390277|t|A rare case report of bilateral common and internal iliac arterial fibromuscular dysplasia: Coexisted dissection, aneurysm, and stenosis.
29390277|a|RATIONALE: Iliac arterial fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was rarely reported and its demographic, clinical, and imaging features have not been precisely described resulting in uncertain therapeutic methods. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old man was referred because of 3-month-ago onset hypertension, low serum potassium, and a small-sized right kidney with normal renal artery under ultrasound examination. This patient was suspected of primary aldosteronism, whereas spirolactone was poorly effective. DIAGNOSIS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and three-dimensional reconstruction of the whole aorta discovered an aneurysm from the right common iliac artery (CIA) to the internal iliac artery, consistent with a left CIA dissection and a remarkable right renal artery aneurysm before a stenosis. Iliac and renal arteries FMD were then confirmed through digital subtraction angiography (DSA). INTERVENTION: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of right renal artery was operated and a stent was deployed in left CIA. OUTCOMES: This patient was normotensive, asymptomatic, and free from recurrence without any antihypertensive agents at an 8-month follow-up. LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is the first bilateral common and internal iliac arterial FMD case in China, with unique asymptomatic dissection, aneurysm, and renovascular hypertension. Screening for secondary hypertension in young population and for iliac or renal arterial FMD is therefore suggested with CTA and reconstruction from neck to pelvis and MRA in those with intracranial disorders. Among youth FMD, the potential of PTRA in renovascular hypertension out of antihypertensive drugs and stent in dissection is novelly indicated.

29397961|t|The management of pediatric renovascular hypertension: a single center experience and review of the literature.
29397961|a|INTRODUCTION: Renal artery occlusive disease is poorly characterized in children; treatments include medications, endovascular techniques, and surgery. We aimed to describe the course of renovascular hypertension (RVH), its treatments and outcomes. METHODS: We performed literature review and retrospective review (1993-2014) of children with renovascular hypertension at our institution. Response to treatment was defined by National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents at most-recent follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 39 patients with RVH. 54% (n=21) were male, with mean age of 6.93 +- 5.27 years. Most underwent endovascular treatment (n=17), with medication alone (n=12) and surgery (n=10) less commonly utilized. Endovascular treatment resulted in 18% cure, 65% improvement and 18% failure; surgery resulted in 30% cure, 50% improvement and 20% failure. Medication alone resulted in 0% cure, 75% improvement and 25% failure. 24% with endovascular treatment required secondary endovascular intervention; 18% required secondary surgery. 20% of patients who underwent initial surgery required reoperation for re-stenosis. Mean follow-up was 52.2 +- 58.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: RVH treatment in children includes medications, surgical or endovascular approaches, with all resulting in combined 79% improvement in or cure rates. A multidisciplinary approach and individualized patient management are critical to optimize outcomes. TYPE OF STUDY: Retrospective comparative study LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

29398271|t|Tread carefully: A functional variant in the human NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is not disease causing.
29398271|a|In this study, we report a paediatric patient with a lethal phenotype of respiratory distress, failure to thrive, pancreatic insufficiency, liver dysfunction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, bone marrow suppression, humoral and cellular immune deficiency. To identify the genetic basis of this unusual clinical phenotype and potentially make available the option of future prenatal testing, whole exome sequencing (WES) was used followed by functional studies in a bid to confirm pathogenicity. The WES we identified a homozygous novel variant, AK298328; c.9_10insGAG; p.[Glu3dup], in NOX4 in the proband, and parental heterozygosity for the variant (confirmed by Sanger sequencing). NADPH Oxidase 4 NOX4 (OMIM 605261) encodes an enzyme that functions as the catalytic subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex. NOX4 acts as an oxygen sensor, catalysing the reduction of molecular oxygen, mainly to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, although, our functional data including 60% reduction in NOX4 protein levels and a 75% reduction in the production of H2O2 in patient fibroblast extracts compared to controls was initially considered to be the likely cause of the phenotype in our patient, the potential contribution of the NOX4 variant as the primary cause of the disease was clearly excluded based on following pieces of evidence. First, Sanger sequencing of other family members revealed that two of the grandparents were also homozygous for the NOX4 variant, one of who has fibromuscular dysplasia. Second, re-evaluation of more recent variant databases revealed a high allele frequency for this variant. Our case highlights the need to re-interrogate bioinformatics resources as they are constantly evolving, and is reminiscent of the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) story, where a functional defect in fatty acid oxidation has doubtful clinical ramifications.

29421412|t|Right Subclavian Artery Aneurysms with Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29421412|a|Subclavian artery aneurysms (SAAs) are rare and even more uncommon in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). A 20-year-old man with a past medical history of moyamoya disease presented with an abnormal mass shadow in the apex of the right lung on chest X-ray. Based on computed tomography imaging, a diagnosis of right SAA was established, and an excision of the aneurysm was performed. Because the left vertebral artery is dominant, the proximal and distal right subclavian artery and right vertebral artery were clamped. Then, the aneurysm was excised, and resection anastomosis was performed. Histological findings revealed FMD. The postsurgical course has been uneventful after 2 years. Among treatment modalities, open surgery would be the first choice for SAAs with FMD, despite the current era of endovascular surgeries.

29428268|t|Web of the carotid artery: An under-recognized cause of ischemic stroke.
29428268|a|Ischemic stroke has rarely been reported in association with a web of the carotid artery. We describe here an additional case of ischemic stroke caused by a carotid web in a young healthy woman. Detection of this vascular abnormality required the use of CT angiography and cerebral digital subtraction angiography. Although there is little evidence regarding the optimal management of this condition, under medical treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy our patient remained free of recurrent stroke events. This case report study illustrates that the web of the carotid artery is an uncommon cause of stroke which should always be considered and ruled out, especially in young patients with otherwise cryptogenic stroke. Clinicians should be aware of this condition, which represents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

29448245|t|Does Endothelin-1 Raise or Lower Blood Pressure in Humans?
29448245|a|Subject of Review: Gupta et al. [Cell 2017; 170: 522-533] have shown that a genetic variant associated with the 5 vascular diseases is a distal regulator of endothelin (ET)-1 gene (EDN1) expression. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the third intron of the PHACTR1 gene, rs9349379, is the potential variant responsible for increased risk of coronary artery disease, and lower risk of migraine, carotid dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, and hypertension. Since ET-1 acts through ET type B receptors (ETBR) on endothelial cells to stimulate the production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin and induce vasodilation, this may contribute to these findings. Second Opinion: However, ET-1 has been demonstrated to play a role in experimental and human hypertension. How can enhanced transcription of EDN1 and translation leading to increased production of ET-1 by endothelial cells play a role in hypertension despite the availability of data that suggest a hypotensive action of ET-1? This could depend on the genetic background of individuals. In some humans, the increased ET-1 vasoconstrictor action on ETAR and ETBR in vascular smooth muscle might predominate over the vasodilator effects exerted via endothelial ETBR, thus resulting in elevated blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Alternatively, hypertension could be attributed to renal actions of ET-1. Either of these pathophysiological actions may explain a hypertensive role of ET-1 despite a lower risk of hypertension associated with the G allele at rs9349379, the common SNP in the PHACTR1 gene that is a distal regulator of EDN1 and leads to an increased expression of ET-1.

29459079|t|Anti-hypertensive treatment in peripheral artery disease.
29459079|a|Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects more than 200 million people worldwide. Hypertension has been related to increased risk of PAD. The treatment of elevated blood pressure (BP) in these patients is indicated to lower the cardiovascular risk with a BP goal of less than 130/80mmHg. Although there is no evidence that one class of antihypertensive medication or strategy is superior for BP lowering in PAD, the use of renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) inhibitors can be effective to reduce the cardiovascular risk. Beta-blockers (BBs) are not contraindicated. In the presence of carotid atherosclerosis, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors are recommended. In fibromuscular dysplasia the treatment of choice is percutaneous renal angioplasty. In renal artery disease optimal medical therapy includes RAS inhibitors, CCBs, BBs and diuretics.

29472380|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: Current State of the Science: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.
29472380|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as an important cause of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden death, particularly among young women and individuals with few conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patient-initiated research has spurred increased awareness of SCAD, and improved diagnostic capabilities and findings from large case series have led to changes in approaches to initial and long-term management and increasing evidence that SCAD not only is more common than previously believed but also must be evaluated and treated differently from atherosclerotic myocardial infarction. High rates of recurrent SCAD; its association with female sex, pregnancy, and physical and emotional stress triggers; and concurrent systemic arteriopathies, particularly fibromuscular dysplasia, highlight the differences in clinical characteristics of SCAD compared with atherosclerotic disease. Recent insights into the causes of, clinical course of, treatment options for, outcomes of, and associated conditions of SCAD and the many persistent knowledge gaps are presented.

29525759|t|Spontaneous renal infarct heralding bowel ischaemia in an adult male: lessons to learn from a rare clinical association.
29525759|a|Spontaneous renal artery dissection (SRAD) is a rare entity with less than 200 cases reported in literature. It usually affects middle-aged men and the clinical presentation is non-specific. Many times it is associated with conditions such as hypertension, fibromuscular dysplasia or vasculitides. We report the case of a patient who initially had renal infarct due to SRAD and then progressed to have bowel ischaemia. The renal infarct preceded bowel ischaemia in this patient and to the best of our knowledge this is the first such association reported in literature. Our report emphasises the point that whenever this condition is diagnosed in a patient one should be vigilant for other vascular disorders.

29528871|t|Echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular morphology and function in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia: the ARCADIA-POL study.
29528871|a|OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive assessment of left ventricle (LV) structure, and function and to detect alterations in cardiac properties in relationship to presence, subtypes and extent of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). METHODS: We studied 144 patients with FMD. The control group consisted of 50 matched individuals. Office and ambulatory blood pressure levels were evaluated. Echocardiography was employed to assess: left ventricular mass index (LVMI), systolic function including speckle tracking echocardiography and diastolic function assessed by mitral flow and tissue Doppler imaging. RESULTS: There were no differences in LV morphology and function between patients with FMD and the control group. Among 128 patients with renal FMD, there were no differences in LVMI and LV systolic function between patients with unifocal and multifocal FMD. The patients with multifocal FMD were characterized by lower early diastolic velocity (e') as compared with unifocal FMD and control groups. However, in a multivariate regression model, e' was not independently correlated with FMD. There were no associations between echocardiographic indexes and vascular involvement of FMD. Also, there were no differences in LV morphology and function in patients with significant renal artery stenosis (RAS) compared with patients with history of significant RAS and patients with nonsignificant RAS. CONCLUSION: Our study in contrast to those with atherosclerotic RAS, did not show differences in LV morphology and function between FMD patients and matched controls. Although FMD can result in hypertension and serious vascular complications, there is no proof that it can alter LV regardless of FMD type and its extent.

29534984|t|Fibromuscular Dysplasia: Contemporary Concepts and Future Directions.
29534984|a|Fibromuscular dyplasia (FMD) is an under-recognized non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory arteriopathy that occurs most commonly in middle-aged women, but may affect individuals of all age groups. FMD may result in stenosis, aneurysm, dissection, occlusion, or arterial tortuosity. Recently published data demonstrated a genetic association of FMD with a variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1), substantiating that the pathogenesis of this condition has genetic contribution. The renal and extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries are most often involved, although any arterial bed may be affected. Clinical manifestations often reflect the vascular territory affected, and can include hypertension, headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack and stroke. While the gold standard for diagnostic evaluation of FMD remains catheter-based angiography, noninvasive imaging, including duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography, may be used for diagnosis. Treatment of FMD depends upon symptoms as well as the nature and location of arterial lesions, but may include both medical (blood pressure control, antiplatelet agents) and interventional (angioplasty, stents, coils, surgery) therapies. This contemporary analysis of the literature, combined with our own clinical experience in treating patients with FMD, will highlight pathophysiology, evaluation, management, and common misconceptions in the care of individuals with FMD.

29535868|t|Factors Associated with Outcomes of Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty in Patients with Renal Artery Stenosis: A Retrospective Analysis of 50 Consecutive Cases.
29535868|a|Background: The results of recent trials have brought some confusion to the treatment strategy for renal artery stenosis (RAS). To evaluate the applicability of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for RAS, we extracted the factors that may affect the effectiveness of PTRA from cases experienced at a hypertension center. Methods and Results: We retrospectively assessed the blood pressure (BP) lowering effects and renoprotective effects in 50 consecutive patients that had hemodynamically significant RAS and had undergone PTRA and stenting during 2001-2005. Subjects were diagnosed with atherosclerotic RAS (42), fibromuscular dysplasia (6), or Takayasu disease (2). After PTRA, BP significantly lowered from 152.3/80.3 mmHg to 132.6/73.2 mmHg (p &lt; 0.05), but the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not change significantly. There were no factors associated with the BP lowering effects of PTRA. The baseline resistive index (RI) was negatively correlated with the change in eGFR (p &lt; 0.05). After correction for age, sex, BMI, and the dose of contrast medium, the association of RI with change in eGFR remained significant. Conclusion: In cases with hemodynamically significant RAS, PTRA lowered BP but was not effective in improving renal function. Higher baseline RI may be a factor for predicting poor clinical course of renal function after PTRA.

29560003|t|A Rare Case of Carotid Web Presenting with Ischemic Stroke in a Young Woman and a Brief Review of the Literature.
29560003|a|Carotid web is a radiological description of a shelf-like intraluminal filling defect in the carotid bulb. It is histologically defined as atypical fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), with abnormal fibrosis and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in the tunica intima. The spur-like intraluminal protrusion can serve as a nidus for thrombus formation, which could cause systemic embolism and ischemic strokes. We report a case of a 20-year-old female patient presenting with acute ischemic stroke in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. We also discuss the incidence, the prevalence, the pathophysiology, the treatment, and the recurrence of carotid web based on the currently available literature.

29568781|t|Renal Artery Rupture in Association With Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29568781|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia is a noninflammatory arteriopathy of unknown etiology that affects medium-sized arteries. Although patients affected with it are often asymptomatic, some might have recurrent catastrophic events that depend mainly on the arterial bed involved. The most worrisome vascular complications of the disease are aneurysmal rupture and arterial dissection. Herein, we report a case of a 49-year-old woman who presented with sudden-onset abdominal pain without any inciting factors. She was found to have active blood extravasation from a capsular branch of the renal artery that happened spontaneously. Angiography revealed fibromuscular dysplasia in the renal arteries without any obvious aneurysms. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature describing such an event. In this article, we also review the possible underlying pathology behind such an event.

29628950|t|Safety Assessment of Endovascular Treatment of Cerebral Aneurysms in Patients with Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29628950|a|Background: The prevalence of cerebral aneurysms is increased in fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). The presence of FMD may serve as discouragement to elective endovascular aneurysm treatment. Outcomes of endovascular intervention for aneurysms through vessels affected by FMD have not been reported. Methods: A prospectively maintained database of patients undergoing intracranial embolization was reviewed for patients with FMD who underwent endovascular aneurysm treatment. Results: A total of 1,025 patients were screened and 31 (3.0%) had cerebrovascular FMD. These patients underwent a total of 43 embolization procedures; 27 of these procedures were performed through an affected vessel. All but 1 patient were female and the average age was 62 years. "String-of-pearls"-type FMD was the most common subtype (90%). The internal carotid arteries were more commonly affected (65%) than the vertebral arteries (48%). All patients underwent treatment of cerebral aneurysms, most of which (87%) were incidentally discovered; 6 patients (19%) also had incidental vessel dissection. The average aneurysm size was 7.1 mm. The morphology was saccular in 93% of the cases, and 86% were in the anterior circulation. The most commonly performed treatment was flow diversion (67%), in the majority of cases by pipeline embolization. Other procedures performed were coiling (19%), stent-coiling (12%), and intrasaccular flow disruption (2%). All but 1 procedure (98%) were successful. There were no major complications; 1 patient experienced a transient ischemic attack. Follow-up angiography was performed in 88% of the cases, without evidence for disease progression after treatment. The average time to last angiographic follow-up was 17 months (+-13). Conclusions: Elective embolization of intracranial aneurysms can be performed safely through vessels affected by FMD.

29630904|t|Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: Cardiac Manifestations of Vascular Disease.
29630904|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in young women who otherwise do not have traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease. Though previously considered to be a rare occurrence and primarily associated with pregnancy, contemporary series have demonstrated that SCAD may account for 35% of ACS in women under the age of 50 years, and peripartum SCAD accounts for the minority of cases. Importantly, an association between SCAD and arterial abnormalities in non-coronary arterial distributions has been described. The most common of these arterial abnormalities is fibromuscular dysplasia. This manuscript will briefly review the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of SCAD and provide an overview of how SCAD may be a cardiac manifestation of an underlying vascular disease in the majority of patients.

29650765|t|Prospective Cardiovascular Genetics Evaluation in Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection.
29650765|a|BACKGROUND: Previous studies describing genetics evaluation in spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) have been retrospective in nature or presented as single case reports. As part of a dedicated clinical program, we evaluated patients in cardiovascular genetics clinic to determine the role of genetically triggered vascular disease and genetic testing in SCAD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patient data were entered prospectively into the Massachusetts General Hospital SCAD registry database from July 2013 to September 2017. Clinically indicated genetic testing was conducted based on patient imaging, family history, physical examination, and patient preference. Of the 107 patients enrolled in the registry, 73 underwent cardiovascular genetics evaluation at our center (average age, 45.3+-9.4 years; 85.3% female), and genetic testing was performed for 44 patients. A family history of aneurysm or dissection was not a prevalent feature in the study population, and only 1 patient had a family history of SCAD. Six patients (8.2%) had identifiable genetically triggered vascular disease: 3 with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (COL3A1), 1 with Nail-patella syndrome (LMX1B), 1 with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD1), and 1 with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (SMAD3). None of these 6 had radiographic evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, 8.2% of the SCAD patients evaluated had a molecularly identifiable disorder associated with vascular disease. The most common diagnosis was vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Patients with positive gene testing were significantly younger at the time of their first SCAD event. A low threshold for genetic testing should be considered in patients with SCAD.

29679353|t|Low frequency of cervicocranial artery involvement in Japanese with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia compared with that of Caucasians.
29679353|a|BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which usually affects the renal artery, also affects the carotid, vertebral, and intracranial arteries. Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of concomitant renal artery and cervicocranial lesions in FMD patients. However, the analyzed subjects were mostly Caucasians in Western countries. METHOD: We performed a retrospective analysis to examine the prevalence of cervicocranial vascular lesions in Japanese FMD patients with renal artery involvement at a single institution. The presence of cervicocranial lesions was evaluated by Doppler echography and magnetic resonance angiography. We compared this prevalence with that reported in the literature. RESULT: Thirty-one Japanese FMD patients with renal artery lesions were studied. The mean age was 30 +- 12 years, 71% were women, and 16% were smokers; all patients were Asians and had hypertension. Multifocal, tubular, and unifocal types of renal lesions were found in 52, 35, and 13% of patients, respectively. Bilateral renal lesions were found in 13% of patients. None of the patients had a cervical vascular lesion associated with FMD. Only two patients (8%) had a lesion in the intracranial artery, of which one was a known case of moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cervical artery involvement and intracranial artery involvement are not common in renal FMD patients in Japan, which is in contrast to the data reported for Caucasian patients in Western countries. Ethnic differences could influence the occurrence of cervicocranial lesions. A study with a larger sample size should be performed to validate these findings.

29709926|t|A Unique Case of Renovascular Hypertension due to Fibromuscular Dysplasia in an Extra-renal Artery.
29709926|a|A 33-year-old man was admitted to our hospital to undergo an evaluation to determine the cause of secondary hypertension. Computerized tomography angiography (CTA) showed bilateral multiple renal arteries with significant stenosis of the right extra-renal artery due to fibromuscular dysplasia and segmental impairment of renal perfusion. Although the plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity were within the normal ranges, percutaneous balloon dilatation of the stenotic lesion resolved his hypertension, leading to a diagnosis of renovascular hypertension caused by segmental renal ischemia due to extra-renal artery stenosis. CTA should be considered during the examination of patients with early-age hypertension, even if the plasma renin activity is not sufficiently elevated.

29709948|a|A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of abdominal pain and disturbed consciousness. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed right vertebral artery dissection and abdominal enhanced computed tomography showed dissection of the superior mesenteric artery. The patient was diagnosed as having fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) based on conventional angiography. Although multiple vascular bed involvement is observed in approximately 40% of FMD patients, reports of sequential symptomatic dissections in various vascular beds are rare. Patients with FMD and dissection require close observation, and hemodynamic stabilization may prevent not only the further development of dissection, but also subsequent dissection of other arteries.

On continuous Doppler imaging, the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at the stenotic site of the left renal artery was 404 cm/s. The FMD formed a "string-of-beads" appearance on computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and renal artery angiography. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) with a balloon catheter was performed, after which the left renal artery returned to near normal, and his blood pressure decreased to within the normal range. In this case, the main cause of refractory hypertension was considered to have been renal artery stenosis due to left FMD.

As the intima rupture did not lead to blood input into arterial wall, but was accompanied by superimposed thrombosis, we suggested to denote such cases as incomplete dissection.

29869115|t|Imaging studies in pediatric fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD): a single-center experience.
29869115|a|BACKGROUND: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory vascular disease that in children unlike in adults shows no sex predilection. FMD is often underdiagnosed, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Delayed diagnosis may lead to refractory hypertension and decreases the chance of successful treatment. Doppler ultrasound (US), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and catheter-based angiography (angiography) are currently used to help make a clinicoradiological diagnosis of FMD. The main aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of imaging modalities which can allow for earlier and improved detection. Furthermore, an anatomical mapping of the location of lesions can help determine the best treatment modalities. METHODS: All patients with non-syndromic non-inflammatory renovascular hypertension were recruited from the Nephrology Department at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and enrolled in the U.S. FMD Registry maintained at the University of Michigan. Clinical presentation and imaging findings on US, CT, and MRI of children diagnosed with FMD were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis was 7 +- 4.9 years (4 months-17 years). Family history of hypertension (HTN) (52%), FMD (8.7%), Caucasian (60%), headache (48%), and HTN (80%) were the most prevalent symptom and sign at presentation. Bruits were 100% specific for renal artery stenosis (RAS) diagnosis but were heard in the minority of patients (3 patients, 12%). FMD was mainly unifocal within a single site (68%) or multiple sites (28%) and involved the main or first order renal branch in about 68% of children. Isolated distal lesions beyond the second order branches were found in about 25% of children. US imaging was significantly less sensitive than angiography (28%, p = 0.003). MRA had a better sensitivity (62.5%, p = 0.3) than US. Overall, CTA had the best sensitivity (84.2%, p = 0.4) compared to angiography; however, only angiography showed distal vessel disease. CONCLUSIONS: Limitations of the study include the sample size and biases-only patients diagnosed with FMD were included in this study and most patients were referred to a pediatric nephrologist for unexplained hypertension. Angiography should be performed as part of the initial work-up of any child suspected of having renovascular FMD, regardless of the findings seen on US, MRA, or CTA.

29883369|t|Genomics of Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29883369|a|Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is &amp;ldquo;an idiopathic, segmental, non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries&amp;rdquo; (Persu, et al; 2014). FMD can lead to hypertension, arterial dissections, subarachnoid haemorrhage, stroke or mesenteric ischemia. The pathophysiology of the disease remains elusive. While familial cases are rare (&lt;5%) in contemporary FMD registries, there is evidence in favour of the existence of multiple genetic factors involved in this vascular disease. Recent collaborative efforts allowed the identification of a first genetic locus associated with FMD. This intronic variant located in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) may influence the transcription activity of the endothelin-1 gene (EDN1) located nearby on chromosome 6. Interestingly, the PHACTR1 locus has also been involved in vascular hypertrophy in normal subjects, carotid dissection, migraine and coronary artery disease. National and international registries of FMD patients, with deep and harmonised phenotypic and genetic characterisation, are expected to be instrumental to improve our understanding of the genetic basis and pathophysiology of this intriguing vascular disease.

29889158|t|Differences in renal hemodynamics and renin secretion between patients with unifocal and multifocal fibromuscular dysplasia.
29889158|a|OBJECTIVE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) can be classified in a multifocal and a unifocal subtype. As unifocal FMD generally leads to more severe hypertension at younger age, we hypothesized that renal hemodynamics are more disturbed in unifocal renal artery FMD as compared with multifocal FMD, leading to increased renin secretion. METHODS: We measured renal blood flow (Xenon washout method), renin secretion, and glomerular filtration rate per kidney in 101 patients with FMD (26 unifocal and 75 multifocal), all off medication and prior to balloon angioplasty. RESULTS: We found that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were substantially lower in kidneys with unifocal FMD as compared with multifocal FMD. In the affected kidney from patients with unilateral FMD for example, mean renal blood flow was 173 +- 77 in unifocal vs. 244 +- 79 ml/100 g kidney/min in multifocal FMD (P = 0.013). Moreover, lateralization in renin secretion was only observed in a subset of patients with unifocal FMD, but not in any of the patients with multifocal FMD. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the impact of unifocal FMD lesions on the kidney is more severe, resulting in a classical pattern of renovascular hypertension. In multifocal FMD, however, renal blood flow is more preserved, local renin secretion is not increased, and the association between renin levels and blood pressure is inverse. These differences may explain the often more severe clinical presentation and higher success rate of revascularization in unifocal FMD, but also suggest that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension may differ between these two disease entities.

29904459|t|Unusual Presentation of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection in an Older Male.
29904459|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a variant of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) that is poorly understood. SCAD has been linked to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), connective tissue disease (CTD), pregnancy and hormonal imbalance, systemic inflammatory conditions (e.g. IBD, vasculitis), and coronary artery vasospasm rather than traditional cardiac risk factors. Symptomology generally accompanying SCAD is indistinguishable from ACS making the timely recognition and diagnosis vital for prompt treatment. Management of SCAD is not well defined given the absence of guidelines; conservative therapy with or without invasive intervention is assessed on a case-by-case basis. In this article, we report the case of a 62-year-old male, who presented with chest pain and dyspnea on exertion and was found to have an elevated troponin-I level and corresponding electrocardiogram (EKG) findings, subsequently diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography revealed a distal right coronary artery (RCA) dissection, which was confirmed later with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The patient then underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) followed by stenting of the distal RCA and was discharged on optimal medical therapy. Herein, we report a case of SCAD in an otherwise healthy male with chest pain at rest and with mild exertion without conventional cardiac risk factors.

29926082|t|Association of Multifocal Fibromuscular Dysplasia in Elderly Patients With a More Benign Clinical Phenotype: Data From the US Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
29926082|a|Importance: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that predominately affects women and is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. The natural history of FMD among patients diagnosed at an older age is not well understood. Objective: To examine the differences in clinical presentation, arterial bed involvement, vascular events, and need for vascular procedures between younger and older patients with FMD. Design, Setting, and Participants: Analysis of baseline data for patients enrolled in the US Registry for FMD as of December 15, 2016, at referral centers participating in the US Registry for FMD. Patients 18 years and older at the time of enrollment and those with only confirmed multifocal (string of beads type) FMD were included. Patients were categorized according to age at the time of diagnosis (&gt;=65 years vs &lt;65 years). Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence of specific symptoms, vascular events, and prior vascular procedures at the time of enrollment in the registry. Results: A total of 1016 patients were included in the analysis, of whom, 170 (16.7%) were 65 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Older patients with FMD were more likely to be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis (4.2% vs 1.4%; P = .02). Headache and pulsatile tinnitus, both common manifestations of FMD, were less common in older patients (40.5% vs 69.1%; P &lt; .001 and 30% vs 44.6%; P &lt; .001, respectively). Extracranial carotid arteries were more commonly involved in patients 65 years or older at time of diagnosis (87% vs 79.4%; P = .03). There was no difference in prevalence of renal artery involvement, number of arterial beds involved, or diagnosis of any aneurysm. Patients 65 years or older were less likely to have had a major vascular event (37.1% vs 46.1%; P = .03) and fewer had undergone a therapeutic vascular procedure (18.5% vs 33.1%; P &lt; .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In the US Registry for FMD, patients 65 years or older at the time of diagnosis of multifocal FMD were more likely to be asymptomatic, had lower prevalence of major vascular events, and had undergone fewer therapeutic vascular procedures than younger patients. Patients with multifocal FMD diagnosed at an older age may have a more benign phenotype and fewer symptoms.

29942887|a|We report the case of a 44-year-old woman who developed an acute type B aortic dissection caused by an entry tear from an aneurysmal left common iliac artery that extended retrograde to the proximal descending thoracic aorta. She experienced refractory chest pain despite optimal medical management, thereby indicating repair. Endovascular aortic repair was subsequently performed. Intraoperatively, fibromuscular dysplasia was diagnosed by the characteristic appearance of her renal arteries. The patient tolerated the procedure and had resolution of her chest pain. In summary, we present a highly unusual case of type B aortic dissection resulting from a retrograde common iliac artery tear in a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia.

29968847|t|Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia and its effect on the kidney.
29968847|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia is a heterogeneous group of systemic, noninflammatory, and nonatherosclerotic diseases of the vascular wall. It is the second-most common abnormality of the renal artery. Although hypertension is the most common presenting symptom, other symptoms, such as pulsatile tinnitus, stroke, chest pain, or abdominal discomfort, may result from other affected vascular beds. Revascularization of the renal artery appears to be effective at lowering blood pressure in many patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia. For a long time, the intrarenal pathophysiological changes and mechanisms leading to hypertension had hardly been studied in patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia. Recent data, however, has provided more insight into the effects of renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia on the intrarenal microvasculature and the intra-renal renin-angiotensin system in these patients. Moreover, these data have changed our view of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to hypertension in patients with renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia. In this review, we will discuss recent clinical and scientific developments regarding renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia with an emphasis on its effects on the kidney.

29981735|a|Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms are rare. The most common location is the common carotid artery near the bifurcation. The mid to distal internal carotid artery is the second most common location. We are reporting the case of a 64-year-old woman who was admitted to our department for management of an asymptomatic left internal carotid artery aneurysm. Physical examination revealed a pulsatile mass, and imaging confirmed the aneurysm diagnosis. Computed tomography angiography detailed a 28mmx3cmx6cm aneurysm of the left cervical internal carotid artery with tortuous outflow the aneurysm sac. Open repair was undertaken. Exposure with incision anterior to the sternocleidomastoid was performed although extended more superiorly than usual because of the distal aneurysm location. After carotid clamping, the aneurysm was resected and an end-to-end anastomosis with prosthesis was performed. After closure, the patient was extubated demonstrating baseline neurologic function. Histologic examination of the arterial wall confirmed the diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia.

29988870|t|A Challenging Case of Fibromuscular Dysplasia in a Transgender Patient: Is There a Hormonal Link?
29988870|a|Introduction: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) aneurysms are rare vascular conditions. An unusual combination of both diseases is reported. Case report: A 54 year old woman presented with symptomatic SMA aneurysm. A diagnosis of FMD was made on the basis of computed tomography angiography (CTA). The patient had undergone gender reassignment surgery 10 years previously and continued to use both topical and oral hormonal therapy. The patient received open anatomical bypass through a retroperitoneal approach using great saphenous vein. Conclusion: Superior mesenteric artery aneurysms are rare and a diagnosis of FMD should be considered as part of the diagnosis process. Anatomical bypass should be considered carefully in relation to a patient's fitness as well as anatomical suitability.

30027575|t|Time trends regarding the etiology of renal artery stenosis: 18 years' experience from the China Center for Cardiovascular Disease.
30027575|a|The time trends regarding the etiology of renal artery stenosis (RAS) are changing, but few investigations have focused on these issues. This study aimed to analyze the time trends regarding the etiology of RAS in a large patient sample from the China Center for Cardiovascular Disease. Consecutive inpatients with RAS from January 1999 to December 2016 were enrolled in this study. The etiologic diagnosis of RAS was based on established criteria. We retrospectively analyzed the time trends regarding the etiology of RAS during an 18-year period. A total of 2905 patients with RAS were enrolled. There were 2393 (82.4%) patients with atherosclerosis (AS), 345 (11.9%) with Takayasu arteritis (TA), 126 (4.3%) with fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and 41 (1.4%) with other causes. Among all patients (n = 2905), patients aged &lt;= 40 years (n = 450), patients aged &gt;40 years (n = 2455), female patients (n = 1097), male patients (n = 1808), female patients aged &gt;40 years (n = 808), and male patients aged &gt;40 years (n = 1647), there were a gradual increase in the proportion of atherosclerotic RAS (P &lt; 0.05), a gradual decrease in the proportion of RAS caused by TA (P &lt; 0.05), and almost no change in the proportion of RAS caused by FMD during the 18-year period (P &gt; 0.05). The data show that the primary causes of RAS are AS, TA, and FMD. The proportion of RAS caused by AS and TA gradually increased and decreased, respectively, over time, and the proportion of RAS caused by FMD showed no significant change.

30045277|t|Missense mutations in COL4A5 or COL4A6 genes may cause cerebrovascular fibromuscular dysplasia: Case report and literature review.
30045277|a|INTRODUCTION: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare and controversial disease that is seldom associated with genes. Here, we report the discovery of 2 missense mutations in COL4A5 and COL4A6 that may be risk factors for causing cerebrovascular FMD. We performed high-throughput sequencing on a patient with FMD and her probable healthy daughter, then annotated the frequency of a variant in a control or general population and assessed its deleterious effects according to published guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We identified missense mutations in COL4A5 (exon43:c.C3940 &gt; T:p.P1314S) and COL4A6 (exon36:c.C3538 &gt; T:p.P1180S) from the proband and her daughter. Sanger sequencing revealed that these probable causal variants were passed to her from her mother. The two missense mutations may have complex functional effects on the integrity of the cerebral vessel walls, including modulating collagens and promoting angiogenesis expression, may be responsible for cerebrovascular FMD.

30064124|t|Natural History of Cervical Artery Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Associated Neurovascular Events.
30064124|a|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic arteriopathy most often affecting the carotid and renal arteries. In the United States Registry for FMD, 41.7% of patients experienced an aneurysm and/or dissection by the time of entry into the Registry. We sought to determine the occurrence of neurovascular events after FMD diagnosis and any changes on cervical artery imaging that may be attributable to FMD. METHODS: Patients followed at the Mount Sinai Medical Center (US Registry for FMD enrollment center) with confirmed FMD and &gt; 1 cervical artery imaging study (at least +- 6 months from the baseline carotid duplex ultrasound [CDU]) between the years 2003 and 2015 were included. Medical records and cervical artery imaging ([CDU], magnetic resonance angiogram [MRA], and computed tomography angiogram [CTA]) were reviewed. New arterial dissection, aneurysm, transient ischemic attack, stroke, or new FMD findings were recorded. RESULTS: Among 146 FMD patients with complete information, 52 (35.6%) had an aneurysm and 52 (35.6%) had a dissection. Mean clinical follow-up was 35.3 +- 25.3 months (range 5-153 months); patients underwent 4 +- 2.7 CDU (range 1-17); 86.3% had &gt;=1 neck MRA or CTA. After FMD diagnosis, 3 patients (2%) experienced a new carotid artery dissection; 1 patient experienced a stroke due to concomitant atherosclerosis. No new aneurysms occurred. In patients with cervical artery FMD, imaging findings remained stable throughout follow-up. No patient developed new cervical artery FMD findings on follow-up imaging. CONCLUSIONS: No new cervical artery FMD or aneurysm was observed on subsequent imaging. New carotid dissection was uncommon over a mean follow-up period of 35.3 +- 25.3 months and was the only non-atherosclerotic vascular event observed after FMD diagnosis.

30083484|t|Fibromuscular Dysplasia Presenting as a Renal Infarct.
30083484|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a condition caused by an abnormal development or growth of cells in the arterial walls in the body. We present a case of a 49-year-old male who came in with a sudden onset of severe left-sided abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was suggestive of a left renal infarct. He underwent renal angiography that showed FMD and a clot located in the anterior branch of the left renal artery. The patient was then treated with apixaban for the clot and amlodipine for the associated hypertension. Our case will highlight the importance of recognizing renal infarction as an initial presentation of FMD.

30114972|t|Endovascular Repair of Ruptured Hepatic Artery Pseudoaneurysm Secondary to Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
30114972|a|We describe successful endovascular treatment of a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia of the celiac axis leading to development of a common hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm with contained rupture. An 81-year-old woman was transferred to our quaternary care center with concern for a hepatic artery rupture. Further imaging demonstrated a common hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm with surrounding hematoma as well as multifocal areas of narrowing and dilatation in the celiac trunk consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia. A similar pattern was subsequently identified in the bilateral renal and carotid arteries. The patient underwent successful endovascular exclusion of the pseudoaneurysm with a balloon-expandable covered stent and was discharged home without incident. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic arteriopathy that can lead to stenosis, occlusion, dissection, and aneurysm formation. While it primarily affects the carotid and renal arteries, there are rare case reports involving the mesenteric vasculature. Endovascular therapy appears to be a feasible treatment option for the complicated sequelae of this condition in the rare case of mesenteric arterial involvement.

30156710|t|Visceral Fibromuscular Dysplasia: From asymptomatic disorder to emergency.
30156710|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, segmental, non-atherosclerotic and non-inflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to stenosis of small and medium-sized arteries, mostly involving renal and cervical arteries. As a result of better and more systematic screening, it appears that involvement of the splanchnic vascular bed is more frequent than originally assumed. We review epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture as well as diagnosis and treatment of visceral artery (VA) FMD. The clinical picture is very diverse, and diagnosis is based on CT-, MR- or conventional catheter-based angiography. Involvement of VAs generally occurs among patients with multi-vessel FMD. Therefore, screening for VA FMD is advised especially in renal artery (RA) FMD and in case of aneurysms and/or dissections. Treatment depends on the clinical picture. However, the level of evidence is low, and much of the common practice is extrapolated from visceral atherosclerotic disease.

30166859|t|Diagnosis and management of fibromuscular dysplasia and segmental arterial mediolysis in gastroenterology field: A mini-review.
30166859|a|The vascular diseases including aneurysm, occlusion, and thromboses in the mesenteric lesions could cause severe symptoms and appropriate diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing patients. With the development and improvement of imaging modalities, diagnostic frequency of these vascular diseases in abdominal lesions is increasing even with the small changes in the vasculatures. Among various vascular diseases, fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and segmental arterial mediolysis (SAM) are noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic arterial diseases which need to be diagnosed urgently because these diseases could affect various organs and be lethal if the appropriate management is not provided. However, because FMD and SAM are rare, the cause, prevalence, clinical characteristics including the symptoms, findings in the imaging studies, pathological findings, management, and prognoses have not been systematically summarized. Therefore, there have been neither standard diagnostic criteria nor therapeutic methodologies established, to date. To systematically summarize the information and to compare these disease entities, we have summarized the characteristics of FMD and SAM in the gastroenterological regions by reviewing the cases reported thus far. The information summarized will be helpful for physicians treating these patients in an emergency care unit and for the differential diagnosis of other diseases showing severe abdominal pain.

30321677|a|BACKGROUND: The increasing frequency of elderly patients with severe tortuous anatomy, especially when combined with fibromuscular dysplasia, can make intracranial canalization severely difficult or impossible. Computed tomography angiography was used to determine the feasibility of accessing the internal carotid artery (ICA) via a percutaneous translacerum approach. METHODS: Twenty consecutive stroke activations with CT angiography were reconstructed in three-dimensional models to take measurements to assess if currently available technologies could safely provide access. We assessed the diameter of the foramen lacerum and ICA. Entry points and angulations were measured based on trajectory. Our trajectory was based on anatomic observations that provided a safe corridor from the angle of the jaw to the foramen lacerum. RESULTS: Based on the 40 carotid arteries from 20 patients, 77.5% had a large enough foramen lacerum to provide access to the ICA. Although there were no traversals of the pharynx, we noted a 20% traversal of the eustachian tube and 5% traversal of a small maxillary artery branch. There was no large-vessel traversal by the trajectory. All patients with bilateral stenotic foramen lacerum were African-American women; 44% of African-American women had bilateral stenotic foramen lacerum. The diameter of the ICA and foramen lacerum would not be prohibitive of sheath placement in patients without stenosis with adequate canalized length of sheath necessary for stability. CONCLUSIONS: Access of the ICA via the foramen lacerum can be safely performed with currently available technologies.

30343992|t|Surgical Renovascular Reconstruction for Renal Artery Stenosis and Aneurysm: Long-Term Durability and Survival.
30343992|a|OBJECTIVE: To study functional outcome, mortality, and dialysis free survival in patients undergoing open primary surgical repair of renal artery stenosis (RAS) or aneurysm (RAA). METHODS: This was a retrospective single centre study of patients undergoing open surgical renal artery reconstruction from 1993 to 2007. Blood pressure, renal function, dialysis dependence, vessel patency, and mortality were registered. Survival was investigated by cross matching with the population registry, yielding up to 20 years of follow up. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients operated on, 25 (63%) were women. RAS was the indication for reconstruction in 31 patients; 23 had atherosclerotic aetiology (ARAS), and eight had fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Nine patients had RAA. Patients with ARAS were older (p = .008), had more extensive peripheral arterial disease (p = .004), and inferior renal function (p = .003) compared with patients with FMD or RAA. In FMD and RAA, the right renal artery was affected in 13/17 (76%) cases, whereas in ARAS the disease was evenly distributed. In patients with ARAS, 15/25 (60%) stenotic renal arteries (two bilateral procedures) were managed by aorto-renal bypass, and 2/25 (8%) through ilio-renal bypass. In 8/25 (32%) endarterectomy was performed. In FMD, all but one patient underwent aorto-renal bypass. Early mortality was 2.5% (one patient with ARAS). One patient with ARAS required dialysis post-operatively. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in patients with ARAS, from 180 mmHg (median) pre-operatively to 155 mmHg at one month (p = .003) and 160 mmHg at one year (p = .03). Need for medication decreased from three or more drugs to two drugs at one month (p = .01). In FMD, there was a similar tendency. Three patients underwent re-intervention for restenosis: two endovascularly and one by open surgery. The overall 5 year survival was 88%. Median follow up was 10.6 years. CONCLUSION: Open surgical renal arterial reconstruction was performed with low mortality, fairly low morbidity, and excellent durability. Open surgery should still be considered a therapeutic option in complex renal artery disease.

30363186|t|A cause of recurrent strokes: carotid webs detected by CT angiogram.
30363186|a|Carotid webs are an uncommon cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes. They are considered a form of fibromuscular dysplasia, possibly developmental in origin, with non-inflammatory and non-atherosclerotic features and a characteristic appearance on CT angiography. They have been described as a thin intraluminal filling defect along the posterior wall of the carotid bulb in oblique sagittal reformats and a septum on axial CT angiography. Here we summarize two cases of ischaemic strokes secondary to carotid webs with characteristic images. Detection and awareness of carotid webs and their imaging features among radiologists and physicians are important as it is associated with a high risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events.

30402192|t|Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Caused by Aortic Fibromuscular Dysplasia: A Case Report.
30402192|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) mainly develops in medium-sized arteries, including renal, extracranial, and extremity arteries, but it rarely causes abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). A 69-year-old woman with AAA diagnosed on ultrasonography by a home doctor visited our hospital. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a saccular aneurysm of terminal abdominal aorta. We performed abdominal aortic replacement and resected the section with aneurysm. Pathological examination of the wall tissue of the resected aneurysm revealed findings that are consistent with FMD. We report this case of AAA caused by aortic FMD because of its rarity.

30410519|t|Multicenter Experience with Stenting for Symptomatic Carotid Web.
30410519|a|Background: A carotid web (CaW) is a shelf-like lesion in the posterior aspect of the internal carotid bulb and represents an intimal variant of fibromuscular dysplasia. CaW has been associated with recurrent strokes and conventionally treated with surgical excision. We report a multicenter experience of stenting in patients with symptomatic CaWs. Methods: Retrospective review of consecutive patients admitted to 5 comprehensive stroke centers who were identified to have a symptomatic CaW and treated with carotid stenting. A symptomatic CaW was defined by the presence of a shelf-like/linear, smooth filling defect in the posterior aspect of the carotid bulb diagnosed by neck CT angiography (CTA) and confirmed with conventional angiography in patients with negative stroke workup. Results: Twenty-four patients with stented symptomatic CaW were identified (stroke in 83% and transient ischemic attack in 17%). Their median age was 47 years (IQR 41-61), 14 (58%) were female, and were 17 (71%) black. The degree of stenosis by NASCET was 0% (range 0-11). All patients were placed on dual antiplatelets and stented at a median of 9 days (IQR 4-35) after the last event. Closed-cell stents were used in 18 (75%) of the cases. No periprocedural events occurred with the exception of 2 cases of asymptomatic hypotension/bradycardia. Clinical follow-up after stent placement occurred for a median of 12 months (IQR 3-19) with no new cerebrovascular events noted. Functional independence at 90 days was achieved in 22 (91%) patients. Follow-up vascular imaging (ultrasound n = 18/CTA n = 5) was performed at a median of 10 months (IQR 3-18) and revealed no stenosis. Conclusions: Stenting for symptomatic CaW appears to be a safe and effective alternative to surgical resection. Further studies are warranted.

30421267|t|Vascular Genetics: Presentations, Testing, and Prognostics.
30421267|a|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Numerous studies have begun to unravel the genetic basis of not only aortic disease but also other forms of commonly encountered vascular diseases. The goal of this review is to provide clinicians a reference to help identify and diagnose different types of vascular disease with a genetic underpinning. RECENT FINDINGS: Ongoing studies have identified numerous genes involved in the TGF-beta signaling pathway that are also associated with thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, and it is possible to test for pathogenic variants in these genes in the clinical setting using commercially available genetic testing panels. Additional studies have begun to identify genetic variants associated with an increased risk of bicuspid aortic valve, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and fibromuscular dysplasia. With increased availability of low-cost genetic testing, clinicians are now able to not only definitively diagnose some vascular syndromes but also provide information on the risk of disease in other family members, as well as provide guidance in terms of family planning. As the cost of genetic testing continues to drop with the benefit of increasing insurance coverage, genetic data will increasingly become part of clinical care for many patients with vascular disease.

30431564|t|Unique imaging findings in fibromuscular dysplasia of renal arteries: A case report.
30431564|a|RATIONALE: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a rare vascular disorder that causes abnormal cell growth in arterial walls. The classic "string of beads" sign has been reported in many cases, whereas the appearance of tubular stenosis and distal tapering of renal arteries with multiple renal infarctions, as well as left kidney atrophy occurring in one patient, has not been precisely described. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-year-old woman presented to us with a history of elevated blood pressure without any symptoms for the past 1 month. Routine laboratory tests indicated a moderately impaired renal function, and ultrasound examination demonstrated a small-sized left kidney and seriously decreased blood flow of the left renal artery and its branches. DIAGNOSIS: Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomographic angiography (CTA) demonstrated multiple ischemic infarctions in the bilateral kidneys, and FMD was suggested at that time. Thereafter, we performed selective reno-angiography, which confirmed that the all left renal arteries had tubular stenosis and that right renal arterial branches presented distal tapering. INTERVENTION: Antihypertensive drugs were prescribed conservatively, including nifedipine 60 mg/d and prazosin 4 mg/d, to lower the patient's blood pressure. OUTCOMES: The patient had a well-controlled blood pressure and an improved renal function at her 6-month follow-up. LESSONS: We should take the diagnosis of FMD into account if young women develop asymptomatic hypertension. To our knowledge, this is the first case that exhibited renal artery FMD manifesting as tubular stenosis and distal tapering, especially followed by bilateral renal infarctions and significant atrophy of the left kidney. In addition, CTA combined with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) may be more sensitive than other tests with respect to the detection of intrarenal infarctions and arterial variants of FMD.

30448113|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissections (SCADs) are increasingly recognized as an important cause of acute coronary syndromes in predominantly women below 60 years of age. SCAD patients comprise a heterogeneous group, in which it is estimated that a quarter to one third have underlying fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Although the mutual relationship of SCAD and FMD is complex and only partly understood, there seems to be some overlap in genetic background and interaction with endogenous sex-steroids. In this review we provide an update of our current knowledge on these intriguing emerging arteriopathies.

30467965|t|Case reports of coronary fibromuscular dysplasia and spontaneous coronary artery dissections.
30467965|a|Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an important cause of acute coronary syndrome especially in women. The most common underlying predisposing cause of SCAD is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a non-inflammatory arteriopathy that results in weakening of the affected arteries, and can cause dissection or aneurysm. Coronary FMD (CFMD) was described as rare, and was shown to cause SCAD in histopathological case reports. Unfortunately, CFMD is challenging to diagnose on coronary angiography, as the findings can be similar to other causes of coronary artery disease. Therefore, we illustrate two case examples of CFMD on coronary angiography, and highlight findings on optical coherence tomography to aid diagnosis.

30477805|t|Conditions and Factors Associated With Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (from a National Population-Based Cohort Study).
30477805|a|The pathophysiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is heterogeneous, associated with systemic arteriopathies and inflammatory diseases, and often compounded by environmental precipitants, genetics, or stressors. However, the frequency of these associated conditions with SCAD on a population level remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this analysis was to evaluate heterogeneous phenotypes of SCAD in the United States using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample collected from January 1, 2004, to September 31, 2015. Among 66,360 patients diagnosed with SCAD, the mean age was 63.1 +- 13.2 years and 44.2% were women.

30479680|t|Bilateral renal artery stenosis treated with drug-eluting balloon angioplasty in unique treatment.
30479680|a|Renal artery stenosis commonly manifests with hypertension refractory to medical treatment. We report a case of renal artery stenosis occurring in a 19-year-old female patient who presented with extremely high blood pressure and bilateral renal stenosis at the duplex ultrasound. Renal angiography confirmed the bilateral and irregular stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia, associated to extent collaterals suppling the poststenotic right renal artery. Therefore, angioplasty with drug-eluting balloon was performed in order to obtain a good vessel patency and to improve patency in the long term follow-up. After the endovascular treatment the blood pressure improved markedly, maintaining this result at 12 months follow-up at clinical examination and duplex ultrasound.

30500650|t|An Unusual Case of Bilateral Upper Extremity Ischemia Caused by Forearm Vessel Fibromuscular Dysplasia.
30500650|a|Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a nonatherosclerotic disease that generally affects medium-sized arteries. The distribution typically involves the renal, extracranial carotid/vertebral, and iliac arteries. FMD in other vascular beds is rare. We herein present the case of a 47-year-old female with rapid-onset bilateral digital ischemia. Initial differential diagnosis included vasospastic disorders and vasculitis. An upper extremity arteriogram was suggestive of ulnar and radial FMD. Percutaneous intervention was not successful, and the patient was managed conservatively with symptomatic improvement. This case highlights the important diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in patients with less common etiologies of upper extremity ischemia.

30510913|t|Awakening the sleeping kidney in a dialysis-dependent patient with fibromuscular dysplasia: A case report and review of literature.
30510913|a|Renal artery stenosis is a common cause of secondary hypertension and chronic kidney disease. We present here a case of fibromuscular dysplasia that was treated with surgical revascularization, resulting in recovery of kidney function with eventual cessation of chronic dialysis. The case involves a 25-year-old female with coincidentally discovered hypertension, who underwent further investigations revealing a diagnosis of renal artery stenosis due to fibromuscular dysplasia. She subsequently developed two episodes of malignant hypertension, with flash pulmonary oedema and worsening renal failure that resulted in dialysis dependence. After evidence was obtained that the right kidney was still viable, a revascularization procedure was performed, improving blood pressure control and restoring kidney function, thereby allowing dialysis to be stopped. This case highlights the importance of evaluating patients with renal artery stenosis for revascularization before committing them to a life of chronic dialysis.

30560699|t|Prevalence of smoking and clinical characteristics in fibromuscular dysplasia. The ARCADIA-POL study.
30560699|a|PURPOSE: Smoking was identified as a potential factor contributing to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). To evaluate the prevalence of smoking and clinical characteristics in FMD subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed 190 patients with confirmed FMD in at least one vascular bed. The rate of smokers in FMD patients was compared to that in two control groups selected from a nationwide survey. RESULTS: The rate of smokers in FMD patients was 42.6%. There were no differences in frequency of smokers between FMD patients and: a group of 994 matched control subjects from general population and a group of matched hypertensive subjects. There were no differences in the characteristics of FMD (including rates of multisite FMD and significant renal artery stenosis) and its complications (including rates of dissections and aneurysms) between smokers and non-smokers. Smokers as compared with non-smokers were characterized by higher left ventricle mass index. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference in the rate of smokers between FMD patients and subjects from the general population. Moreover, we did not find any association between smoking and clinical characteristics of FMD patients nor its extent and vascular complications. Our results do not support the hypothesis that smoking is involved in the pathophysiology of FMD.

30571430|t|A Systematic Literature Review of Patients With Carotid Web and Acute Ischemic Stroke.
30571430|a|Background and Purpose- Carotid web (CW) is a rare form of focal fibromuscular dysplasia defined as an abnormal shelf-like projection of intimal fibrous tissue into the carotid bulb. It is theorized that CW leads to ischemic stroke secondary to blood flow stasis and subsequent embolization. The natural history and optimal management of CW are unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of CW. Methods- Our librarians performed a SLR for CW and related terminology. Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, neuroimaging findings, stroke recurrence or stroke free-duration, and treatment modality were extracted. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our results. When specific patient-level metrics were not reported, the denominators for reporting percentage calculations were adjusted accordingly. Results- Our literature search produced 1150 articles. Thirty-seven articles including 158 patients (median age 46 years [range 16-85], 68% women, 76% symptomatic) met entry criteria and were included in our SLR. Of the symptomatic CW patients: 57% did not have stroke risk factors, 56% who received medical therapy had recurrent stroke (median 12 months, range 0-97), and 72% were ultimately treated with carotid revascularization (50% carotid stenting, 50% carotid endarterectomy). There were no periprocedural complications or recurrent strokes in carotid revascularization patients. Conclusions- CW leads to ischemic stroke in younger patients without conventional stroke risk factors. We found a high stroke recurrence rate in medically managed symptomatic CW patients, whereas carotid revascularization effectively prevented recurrent stroke. Our findings should be interpreted with caution because of risk of publication and reporting bias.

30866750|t|Endovascular Treatment of Concomitant Carotid Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Atherosclerotic Disease After Failed Open Surgical Treatment.
30866750|a|We describe a case of concomitant fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) disease in a symptomatic patient. Sixty-eight-year-old female presented for evaluation of a transient ischemic attack. Imaging revealed severe proximal &gt;80% ICA stenosis with severe FMD to mid and distal ICA. Planned hybrid approach with left carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and balloon angioplasty was aborted intraoperatively due to lack of back bleeding. Open gradual rigid dilation was then performed with resumption of back bleeding. Completion angiogram revealed widely patent flow through CEA patch with no residual defects. Patient awoke from operation neurologically intact. At 6-month follow-up, carotid duplex revealed severe recurrent ICA stenosis. Endovascular intervention was performed with balloon dilation to the proximal and mid-ICA with stenting of a moderate 60% ostial common carotid stenosis. She recovered well from procedure with 3-month carotid duplex showing widely patent common carotid stent and ICA with no areas of stenosis. Informed consent has been obtained from the patient for publication of the case report and accompanying images.
